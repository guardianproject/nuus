    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/ongoing-clashes-in-myanmars-rakhine-state-08272019170323.html/myanmar-panmyung-village-residents-rakhine-aug27-2019.jpg"></img><p>Fighting between Myanmar forces and Arakan Army insurgents has prompted about 5,000 residents from two villages in war-ravaged Rakhine state‚Äôs Minbya township to flee their communities since hostilities in the area began four days ago, residents said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Those who fled Panmyaung and Shwekyin villages have sought shelter in Buddhist monasteries or with relatives because of the random firing of heavy weapons by Myanmar troops now stationed on Aung Mingalar Hill in the middle of Panmyaung, they said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe [Myanmar] military has been firing indiscriminately from its base on Aung Mingalar Hill,‚Äù said Panmyaung resident Kyaw Zin.</p>
<p>Of the more than 8,000 people who live in Panmyaung village alone, only about one-third have remained behind, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the villagers from Panmyaung village are terrified, and many have fled. Now, only a third of the villagers are left, remaining behind to take care of their belongings,‚Äù Kyaw Zin said.</p>
<p>Many villagers are staying temporarily with family members who live in the towns of Mrauk-U, Minbya, and Sittwe, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight now, there is some firing from Aung Mingalar Hill as we speak,‚Äù he told RFA‚Äôs Myanmar Service via phone at around 4 p.m. ‚ÄúPeople who are ill will not survive amid these loud blasts.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nyo Maung Thein, administrator of nearby Shwekyin village and a resident of Kyaung Taung village, reported that government soldiers have been firing from military helicopters since shooting began in the morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey have been shooting the entire day since 7 a.m.,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow, two helicopters have flown over. ‚Ä¶ They fired from the helicopters to the northeast of Panmyaung village. That area is northwest of Shwekyin [village].‚Äù</p>
<p>A resident of Kyaung Taung village confirmed the aerial attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, they have been shooting all day,‚Äù said the villager who declined to be named out of concern for his safety. ‚ÄúJust now, they were shooting from the air. It was two helicopters. We saw them shooting from the helicopters.‚Äù</p>
<p><b>‚ÄòOne-sided claims‚Äô</b></p>
<p>Myanmar military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun called the villagers‚Äô reports ‚Äúone-sided claims.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is not just our military firing the weapons,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBoth sides are firing at one another during the battle.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is true that there were armed engagements in the region east of Panmyaung village,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is an AA camp over there, and we are trying to capture that camp. There are no other clashes [in the area].‚Äù</p>
<p>Zaw Min Tun said Myanmar troops were stationed near Panmyaung to ensure the security of the Yangon-Sittwe highway which passes through the area.</p>
<p>Rakhine state lawmaker Hla Thein Aung from Minbya township, who was in Panmyaung village on Tuesday, also confirmed the continuous firing of heavy weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe residents of the village feared that the tragedy that occurred on Aug. 24 might be repeated, so they fled the village,‚Äù he said, referring to the day when an explosion from a stray artillery shell killed three children and injured four other civilians in Panmyaung village.</p>
<p>The Myanmar military and the AA blamed each other for the deaths.</p>
<p>The lawmaker said the villagers asked him to help them force the military to move its base away from their community by collecting signatures on a petition to be submitted to authorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe decided to send the appeals with signatures to the state‚Äôs chief minister, the speaker of the parliament, and the minister for border security,‚Äù he said, adding that he would go to Rakhine‚Äôs capital Sittwe on Friday to submit the document.</p>
<p>AA spokesman Khine Thukha acknowledged that the two forces were engaged in combat in Monday, but said he did not know whether they had clashed near Panmyaung village.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYesterday there was an armed clash about two miles northeast of Panmyaung village,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI heard there are some clashes today. But I don‚Äôt have updates for today yet.‚Äù</p>

Mortar blast kills man</b></p>
<p>In a related development, a mortar shell blast killed one villager and injured another Monday evening amid the continuing conflict between government soldiers and three ethnic armies, including the AA, in northeastern Shan state, a villager said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old man died when he was hit by shrapnel from a stray shell that exploded near his home in Kutkai township‚Äôs Pang Say village, said a neighbor who declined to give his name out of concern for his safety.</p>
<p>The man‚Äôs wife suffered minor injuries, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome shells fell in our village around 6:30 or 7 p.m.,‚Äù the neighbor told RFA. ‚ÄúOne shell exploded about 300 feet or so from his house. The family was not there. [The man] was about to pray upstairs when a piece of shrapnel came through the wall and hit him in the neck ‚Ä¶ and he died on the spot.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause shells were in the air, nobody dared to go and help him,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Other residents told RFA there were clashes Monday evening near Lwe-saing village, west of where Myanmar Infantry Regiment 242 is stationed, and near Loi Sam Sik Hill [in the vicinity of] Kutkai, where both adversaries fired heavy weapons.</p>
<p>The TNLA said in a statement issued Tuesday that the Myanmar military was using heavy weapons, but Zaw Min Tun denied the accusation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious who is hitting civilians,‚Äù he said, referring to the ethnic armies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBetween Kutkai and Nanhpelkar, civilian cars and trucks were shot at,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have recently seen nonmilitary targets being hit. They were hitting non-military vehicles without reason. People should be condemning these acts of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, a passenger car traveling from Kutkai to Muse was fired on near a garbage dump outside Kutkai, wounding a man, a RFA reporter at the scene observed.</p>
<p>Fighting has raged in the area for the past eight days, and traffic along the main highway has been stopped, preventing local villages from traveling to buy rice and other food supplies.</p>
<p><b>China pressures ethnic armies</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, China, which borders Shan state, has been pressuring the alliance of ethnic militaries to stop fighting ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China at the beginning of October, spokesmen from the rebel armies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs from China‚Äôs foreign ministry, met a week ago with the AA, TNLA, and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) in southwestern China‚Äôs Kunming city to tell them that Beijing does not accept the armed conflict, which has increased instability in the border region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was like he pressured both sides to stop fighting and to talk,‚Äù said AA spokesman Khine Thukha on Tuesday. ‚ÄúHe pressured us with the intention of having stability in the China-Myanmar border area.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other thing is that the 70th anniversary of the People‚Äôs Republic of China is Oct. 1, and he wants all organizations [in the border area] to do everything with caution during this period,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The three ethnic armies, which belong to the Northern Alliance, asked Sun for assistance in resuming peace talks with the Myanmar government and military as soon as possible, Khine Thukha said.</p>
<p>The AA along with the Ta‚Äôang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the (MNDAA), conducted coordinated attacks on five locations in Shan state and neighboring Mandalay region on Aug. 15 that left 15 people dead, including Myanmar troops and policemen, in retaliation for government army offensives.</p>
<p>Since then, the armies have launched attacks on roads and bridges and engaged in fighting in Kutkai and Muse townships.</p>
<p>TNLA spokesman Aik Kyaw said the ethnic armies explained to Sun that they launched the armed assaults to defend themselves from Myanmar military attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have asked him [to pass our message to the government army] to stop the offensives in Rakhine, to stop recruiting, and to stop the building of new military posts in the Ta‚Äôang region,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoreover, we told him that the military should let go of its hardline attitude and engage in political dialogue,‚Äù he added</p>
<p>The Myanmar military wants to hold peace talks with Myanmar's ethnic armed organizations, though it is not clear whether the TNLA, AA, and MNDAA will participate.</p>
<p>But Zaw Min Tun denied that Sun had pushed the ethnic armies to stop fighting</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as I know, the Chinese official didn‚Äôt pressure them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe current fighting is taking place along the Union Highway, and everybody knows who is responsible for it. The [Myanmar] military has to protect people and their lives.‚Äù <br/> <i><b></b></i></p>

Others are trafficked and held in debt-traps, or are killed in accidents at work or on the road.<br/><br/>On Monday, the bodies of nine Lao migrants killed on Aug. 18 in a head-on collision while traveling to a border town to renew the tourist visas on which they had entered Thailand were returned to their families. A tenth was cremated in Thailand.<br/><br/>Speaking recently to RFA‚Äôs Lao Service, an official with the Lao Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare said that many Lao who look for jobs in Thailand have not yet finished school.<br/><br/>‚ÄúSome of them have not completed high school,‚Äù the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br/><br/>‚ÄúThese workers are 15, 16, or 17. Their parents push them to go out and earn money, and in Thailand they work at restaurants or in construction,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost of them go there of their own free will, hoping they can make money to help their families.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt say they are going there to work, though. Instead, they say they are going to visit relatives, or as tourists, and we can‚Äôt stop them,‚Äù he said.<br/><br/>Ministry figures indicate that at the beginning of this year, 207,561 Lao migrants were working legally in Thailand, with about 30,000 illegal workers also present in the country. Figures published in May by the Thai Labor Ministry showed 278,485 Lao workers registered in Thailand, however.<br/><br/>The number of Lao migrants working illegally in Thailand illegally was not known, the Thai ministry said.<br/><b><br/>Poverty at home</b><br/><br/>Many of those looking for work in Thailand voice concerns over family poverty as their reason for leaving home.<br/><br/>‚ÄúA friend who is working at a restaurant in Bangkok called me, and so I came. I‚Äôve been working here since June and will go back home in September,‚Äù one 22-year-old Lao woman told RFA.<br/><br/>‚ÄúI need money for myself and for my family, because we‚Äôre poor farmers,‚Äù she said, adding that she earns $400 each month but has to work hard from 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. every day.<br/><br/>‚ÄúWe live in the countryside, where are no jobs and there‚Äôs nothing to do,‚Äù another young Lao woman, a resident of Khammouane province, told RFA in an interview in July. ‚ÄúSo I come here to make money and send it home to pay our family‚Äôs debts.‚Äù<br/><br/>Many young Laotians enter Thailand with the help of middle-men to work illegally, with many later trapped in debt to their employers while others simply vanish.<br/><br/>In Sekong province in southern Laos, where many young people have left to go to Thailand, a provincial anti-human trafficking unit official told RFA his department lacks the funds and human resources to stop or slow the trade.<br/><br/>‚ÄúRecently, two girls left,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne has come back, and the other disappeared.‚Äù<br/><br/>Lao migrants travel back and forth every day through the Chong Mek-Vangtao check point at the border between Champassak province in Laos and Thailand‚Äôs Ubol Ratchthany province, Thai border inspector Ponrpirom Yuthaboon told RFA on Aug. 21.<br/><br/>‚ÄúMany work illegally, and then they get arrested. And sometimes they don‚Äôt return home through this gate.‚Äù<br/><b><br/>Loopholes in the law</b><br/><br/>Some Lao workers enter Thailand as tourists, Samak Tapthanee‚Äîhead of the anti-trafficking unit of the Thai-based Labor Rights Promotion Network‚Äîtold RFA.<br/><br/>‚ÄúSome just have border passes. Others carry passports and then work without a permit. Then they travel to border provinces to renew their visa, which allows them to stay in Thailand for another one to three months.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúThis is one of the loopholes in Thailand‚Äôs laws, and this is a problem right now,‚Äù he said, adding that some Lao workers will not even go back to Laos to have their passport stamped, but will go to the border with Myanmar or Cambodia instead.<br/><br/>On arrival in Thailand, many young Laotians are handed off from one employer to another, some told RFA in interviews.<br/><br/>‚ÄúA middle-man told me that he would take me to Bangkok to work in a factory, but instead he gave me to another Thai man who sold me to a karaoke bar,‚Äù one young girl named Phin from Pakse city in Champassak province told RFA.<br/><br/>Other Lao girls are sold to entertainment venues, restaurants, or factories, Phin said, with employers paying between $250 and $500 to a second middle-man, and employers then deducting pay from the girls‚Äô paychecks every month until their ‚Äúdebt‚Äù is paid.<br/><br/><b>Sexually exploited</b><br/><br/>Many of these women and girls are then sexually exploited, with some entrapped by relatives back home, sources told RFA.<br/><br/>‚ÄúMy own aunt, my father‚Äôs sister, asked me whether I wanted to visit Thailand, and two of my girlfriends went with me,‚Äù one 17-year-old said, speaking to RFA following her return to Laos.<br/><br/>‚ÄúWe crossed the Mekong River, and a Thai woman picked us up at the border and we traveled for a long distance. We then came to a karaoke bar somewhere in Thailand, and my aunt left.‚Äù<br/><br/>The girl and her friends were then forced to ‚Äúserve‚Äù customers, and when they tried to leave were told they each owed the bar owner $4,500, the amount the van driver and the girl‚Äôs aunt had been paid for them, she said.<br/><br/>All three escaped from the bar and returned home last year.<br/><br/>In another case, a 17-year-old girl was lured to Thailand‚Äôs Narathiwat province three years ago to work in a restaurant but was forced into sex work at a karaoke bar, a Thai immigration officer told RFA in a recent interview.<br/><br/>‚ÄúLater, she became pregnant,‚Äù the Thai officer said. ‚Äú[Recently], she escaped and found her way back to Laos, where she was helped by an NGO.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúThai police have arrested the two owners of the bar,‚Äù the officer said, adding that the girl‚Äôs baby was born deformed because she had contracted syphilis while working at the bar.<br/><br/><b>Underpaid, threatened</b><br/><br/>In other cases, Thai employers underpay undocumented Lao workers and then threaten them with arrest by the police if they complain, sources say.<br/><br/>In February, a young couple in their 20s from Saravan province entered Thailand as tourists and stayed to work illegally as a security guard and a housekeeper, they told RFA.¬† Paid less than they were promised, they were then not paid at all for the last three months of their employment, and finally went to the police themselves to complain, they said.<br/><br/>Speaking to RFA, the husband said he and his wife are now in hiding, protected by the Labor Rights Promotion Network, while they seek authorities‚Äô help to recover the money they are owed.<br/><br/>‚ÄúAccording to Thai law, we should be paid, and as soon as we get our money we‚Äôll go back home,‚Äù he said.<br/><br/>Also speaking to RFA, an official with Thailand‚Äôs Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare said the Lao couple will get their pay, adding, ‚ÄúOur job is to protect and help workers without discriminating against particular nationalities.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúIf they worked, they will be paid,‚Äù he said.<br/><br/><i><b>Reported by RFA‚Äôs Lao Service.
