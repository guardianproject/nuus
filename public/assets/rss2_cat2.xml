		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Dozens of nongovernmental organizations marked International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists Friday by slamming Cambodia for failing to hold the perpetrators of crimes against reporters and rights activists accountable and demanding independent, transparent probes of their cases.<br/><br/>“When journalists are targeted by violence for what they write or report, freedom of expression is stifled and replaced by self-censorship and fear; the public is denied information; and the powerful cannot be held to account,” said the statement, signed by 42 watchdogs—including global groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, and local organizations Adhoc and Licadho.<br/><br/>“When the state fails to investigate and punish violence against journalists, it sends a chilling message that attacks on journalists are permissible.”<br/><br/>The NGOs noted that since 1994, at least 13 journalists have been murdered in Cambodia for their reporting, and that all but one of them were “engaged in activities that posed a direct threat to powerful individuals within the Cambodian elite.”<br/><br/>In 11 of the cases, no one was convicted for the murders, the groups said, while in seven, no suspect was arrested or interrogated. “Serious concerns remain” in the two cases where a trial took place, they added.<br/><br/>And while no journalists have been killed in the last two years in Cambodia, reporters are regularly targeted with judicial harassment, according to the statement, including trumped-up charges, and media outlets perceived as critical of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s regime have been forced to close.<br/><br/>The groups noted that impunity in Cambodia is not limited to attacks against journalists, citing the murders of environmental activist Chut Wutty, trade unionists Chea Vichea and Ros Sovannareth, and political analyst Kem Ley as representative of “the thousands of instances of abuse” against outspoken critics that have “gone unaddressed” by authorities.<br/><br/>“We condemn the rampant impunity that harms Cambodian people and society and demand justice for all those whose rights have been cast aside,” the groups said.<br/><br/>“We call on the authorities to prosecute perpetrators of crimes committed against journalists and human rights defenders by undertaking effective, independent, and transparent investigations and prosecutions in accordance with international human rights standards … and to restore the integrity of the Cambodian legal system.”<br/><br/><strong>Call for justice</strong><br/><br/>Separately on Friday, Club of Cambodia Journalists president Pen Bona urged authorities to seek justice for the 13 slain journalists—Thou Char Mongkol, Nun Chan, Chan Dara, Thun Bun Ly, Chet Duong Daravuth, Pich Em, Dok Sokhan, Ou Saroeun, Chour Chetharith, Khim Sambo, Hang Serei Oudom, Suon Chan, and Taing Try.<br/><br/>Speaking in an interview with RFA’s Khmer Service, he said it was a “good sign” that no reporters had been killed in Cambodia over the past two years, but questioned why there have been no breakthroughs in finding those responsible for the 13 murders since 1994, despite authorities claiming that they continue to investigate the cases.<br/><br/>Ministry of Interior spokesman Khieu Sopheak could not be reached for comment Friday, but has previously pledged that authorities “won’t close those cases until the perpetrators are brought to justice.”<br/><br/>But Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin on Friday hit out at the statement from the NGOs, telling RFA that “there is no impunity” in the cases of the slain journalists, as investigations continue.<br/><br/>“It isn’t impunity—it’s still at the investigative stage,” he said, adding that the cases are “complicated” and require more time to close.<br/><br/>Nop Vy of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media, however, refuted Chin Malin’s claims, noting that the journalists had all been killed after reporting on sensitive issues, including corruption scandals involving powerful people.<br/><br/>He urged authorities to “be more responsible” because journalists are working to improve society, and said a culture of impunity had negatively impacted local reporting.<br/><br/>“We have seen a delay in bringing justice to victims,” he said, adding that authorities should “speed up investigations to end impunity.”<br/><br/><strong>Internet freedom</strong><br/><br/>Friday’s statement came days after U.S. NGO Freedom House said in its annual “Freedom on the Net” report that of the 65 countries it monitors, Cambodia was one of five nations that “experienced the steepest deterioration in internet freedom over the last five years,” citing amendments initiated by the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) that led to an uptick in arrests for online political commentary.<br/><br/>Freedom House designated Cambodia “partly free” with a score of 55 over the past year, on a scale where zero represents “most free” and 100 indicates “least free,” noting a crackdown on online dissent by Hun Sen’s government that led to a “surge in arrests and prison sentences,” and ensured his party’s victory ahead of a July 29 election.<br/><br/>Council of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan slammed the Freedom House report Friday as “bogus and lies,” saying Cambodia “doesn’t have any law restricting internet freedom.”<br/><br/>Phay Siphan said Hun Sen’s regime is working to improve internet access for everyone throughout the country, but warned that internet freedom “doesn’t give users free rein to insult people or incite violence.”<br/><br/>When asked about claims in the report that China has provided Cambodia with training on how to monitor the internet use of its citizens, the spokesman said that authorities “only monitor the internet to fight against terrorism and for other security reasons.”<br/><br/><strong>Requesting happier news</strong><br/><br/>Also on Friday, Hun Sen’s wife and Cambodia Red Cross chairwoman Bun Rany urged members of the local media to “decrease reporting on crimes, rapes, and deaths from traffic accidents,” asking them to instead focus on the work her husband’s government has done to develop the country.<br/><br/>Pro-government media outlet Fresh News quoted Bun Rany during a donation distribution in Kampong Chhnang province as saying that “local TV stations don’t broadcast news about government efforts that have helped to develop the country, but only about violent crimes, suicides, traffic accidents, rapes and killings.”<br/><br/>“Every morning, I only see news about people dying, rapes and killings. I would like to use this forum to appeal to all TV stations to broadcast government achievements instead of bad topics.”<br/><br/>The Red Cross chairwoman did not specify what kind of developments she would prefer the nation’s news organizations to focus on.<br/><strong><i><br/>Reported by RFA’s Khmer Service.

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China is confronting multiple setbacks, flaws, and failures in President Xi Jinping’s ambitious overseas infrastructure project—the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>Experts note that more than five years after its launch, three of the six economic corridors planned for the massive initiative, often referred to as the BRI, lack any Chinese-funded major projects.</p>
<p>And it appears that the BRI isn’t as well organized as some believe it to be.</p>
<p>Some nations worry about debts that they owe to China for project loans. Critics describe these as part of a kind of Chinese “debt-trap diplomacy.”</p>
<p>Others fear that Chinese-built infrastructure projects, such as ports, dams, and railways, will result in an increase in Chinese political and strategic influence.</p>
<p>According to Jonathan E. Hillman, senior fellow of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, the BRI’s “sheer scale demands attention.”</p>
<p>Spanning roughly 80 countries, it can claim to cover more than two-thirds of the world’s population,” says Hillman.</p>
<p>“It could include Chinese investments approaching $1 trillion, seven times what the United States spent during the Marshall Plan.”</p>
<p>It will also carry exports, people, and data across the Eurasian supercontinent.</p>
<p>So in many ways, says Hillman, “when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world.”</p>
<p><strong>A poll shows concerns about China’s ambitions</strong></p>
<p>But a recent survey conducted by a Singapore-based think-tank shows that many Southeast Asian nations are wary of the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>The ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute polled 1,008 respondents from all 10 members states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>The respondents included government officials, scholars, business people, and members of civil society and the media.</p>
<p>Some 73 percent of the respondents believe that China has more political and strategic influence in the region than the United States.</p>
<p>But the respondents to the poll, which was released on Jan. 6, expressed concerns about China’s geostrategic ambitions.</p>
<p>Fewer than one in 10 saw China as “a benign and benevolent power,” with nearly half saying that Beiing possesses “an intent to turn Southeast Asia into a sphere of influence.”</p>
<p>Some 70 percent said that their governments “should be cautious in negotiating BRI projects to avoid getting into unsustainable financial debts to China,” a view described as strongly held in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matt Schrader of the U.S.-based Jamestown Foundation says that inside China itself some experts have even dared to question President Xi’s “excessive ‘foreign aid’ to countries in Africa and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>According to Schrader, such criticism is “an obvious reference to Xi Jinping’s globe-spanning Belt and Road Initiative.”</p>
<p>This is remarkable, because criticism inside China of the all-powerful Chinese leader has been rare—at least until recently.</p>
<p>As Schrader describes it, the BRI is “a hallmark of Xi Jinping’s foreign policy.”</p>
<p>But he also says that BRI lending “has already begun to shrink, decreasing dramatically since 2015.”</p>
<p><strong>A project that ‘can’t be allowed to fail’</strong></p>
<p>China is expected to continue to expand its outreach to new countries through the BRI, partly because it has been written into the Chinese Communist Party’s constitution.</p>
<p>At the Party’s 19<sup>th</sup> National Congress held in late October of 2017, the Party’s amended charter pledged to “pursue the Belt and Road Initiative.”</p>
<p>Reuters reporter Jason Lee said that this is evidence that President Xi’s ambitious project will endure even beyond his tenure.</p>
<p>He cited analysts as saying that it also “underscored how the Communist Party has increased its attention to foreign policy and reflects Xi’s growing desire for China to take a leadership role.”</p>
<p>And as some analysts describe it, the BRI has now become “too important to fail.”</p>
<p>This has contributed to a perception that China is now moving methodically and successfully to create client states that will help advance its military and geopolitical ambitions.</p>
<p>But Hillman at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies disagrees with this perception.</p>
<p><strong>More chaos than conspiracy</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>In an analysis published on Sept. 4, 2018, by CSIS, Hillman wrote that since the BRI was launched in 2013, it “has yet to materialize on the ground as promised.”</p>
<p>The BRI includes six economic corridors, but Hillman says that a statistical analysis of 173 infrastructure projects finds that “Chinese investment is just as likely to go outside these corridors than in them.</p>
<p>In his analysis, Hillman argued that much of the BRI’s activity looked more “scattered and opportunistic” than part of a well-implemented grand design.</p>
<p>David Fickling, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities as well as industrial and consumer companies, agrees with Hillman’s view.</p>
<p>In an article published by Bloomberg recently under the title “Belt and Road Is More Chaos Than Conspiracy,” Fickling argues that “…the initiative isn’t ultimately a connected master plan for Chinese global ascendancy.”</p>
<p>Instead, he says, “it’s better looked at as a somewhat chaotic branding and franchising exercise.”</p>
<p>Alternatively, he says, it’s “a way for the country’s numerous provincial officials and state-owned companies to slip a presidential seal of approval on whatever project they’re seeking to pursue.”</p>
<p>Fickling adds that the prestige of the BRI “may even end up being used to sell projects that are not just illogical but corrupt.”</p>
<p>And as he describes it, “the massive web of private contracts, public funds and gate-keeping officials that support major infrastructure projects in emerging countries” offer many opportunities for graft.</p>
<p><strong>Pushback against the BRI</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Some countries are pushing back against proposed Chinese infrastructure plans while others are sounding the alarm about already completed but flawed projects.</p>
<p>Some planned projects are simply going nowhere.</p>
<p>As Fickling notes, when it comes to failures in implementation, oil and gas pipelines linking a planned $9.6 billion dollar port in Myanmar to China’s Yunnan Province are barely used five years after being launched.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, a high-speed train project to connect the capital of Jakarta to the West Java capital of Bandung is running more than two years behind schedule and has “barely started construction.”</p>
<p>In March of 2016, Liu Zhen reported in the <i>South China Morning Post</i> that provincial representatives in Indonesia had criticized the planned project for being “too costly, unfair to less developed regions, and unhelpful to the poor.”</p>
<p>In an article published on Sept.6 last year by the Hong Kong-based website <i>Asia Times</i>, Indian scholar Gunjan Singh wrote that the number of countries expressing concern over Chinese investments adding to their debt was on the rise.</p>
<p>Officials in South and Southeast Asian countries worry that China will eventually use countries’ inability to pay back debt as an excuse to gain control of vital transportation links, such as ports and railways.</p>
<p>As Singh notes, the first prominent victim of Chinese infrastructure investments has been the South Asian nation of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Last December, a heavily indebted Sri Lanka was forced to lease out its Hambantota Port and land around it to a Chinese shipping country for 99 years.</p>
<p>Malaysia announced last August that it wouldn’t be going ahead with three major Chinese projects that would have cost some $20 billion.</p>
<p>On Jan. 12, <i>The Washington Post</i> summed up in an editorial what it described as “jaw dropping corruption” driving Chinese investment in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Thanks to reporters of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, we know that Chinese officials offered in 2016 to help then-Prime Minister Najib Razak avoid a financial scandal.</p>
<p>In exchange, they asked that Najib agree to railway and pipeline projects to be built at inflated prices by Chinese state companies.</p>
<p>Previously, <i>The</i> Wall Street <i>Journal</i> had helped to expose how Najib had illegally acquired hundreds of millions of dollars from a Malaysian state investment fund.</p>
<p>Malaysia’s anti-corruption agency has meanwhile charged Najib with three counts of money laundering. Najib denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as David Fickling reports, three of the six trans-Asia economic corridors around which the BRI was originally designed are “devoid of major projects, while countries well outside its original scope such as Nigeria and Argentina are being brought under the Belt and Road umbrella.”</p>
<p>And as if corruption or the backlash against faulty and failed projects were not enough, there’s the issue of environmental damage caused by the BRI that could threaten global climate progress.</p>
<p>A report published on Jan. 3 of this year by the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies says that the BRI has the potential to transform  economies in China’s partner countries.</p>
<p>But the report, authored by Isabel Hilton, a London-based writer, broadcaster, and commentator, also concludes that with its focus on building coal-fired power plants along the way, the BRI “could also tip the world into catastrophic climate change.”</p>
<p>The report says that building the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Maritime Silk Road will absorb massive amounts of concrete, steel, and chemicals, creating power stations, mines, and container ports, many in countries with poor environmental oversight.</p>
<p>“While China has imposed a cap on coal consumption at home,” the report says, “its coal and energy companies are on a building spree overseas.”</p>
<p>Only scattered popular protests against the BRI have been documented.</p>
<p>But a few have gained international media attention.</p>
<p>In 2018, protesters in a number of cities in Vietnam opposed plans to build new special economic zones (SEZs) where Chinese factories were expected to be opened.</p>
<p>The protesters clashed with the police, and Vietnam’s National Assembly was forced to delay a vote on the zones that would have allowed them to be leased for up to 99 years.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Chinese fishermen are damaging the livelihoods of South Americans through large-scale illegal fishing.</p>
<p>The fishermen have been visible in the Pacific Ocean for several years, and there’s nothing illegal about their fishing in international waters.</p>
<p>But according to Evan Ellis, an American expert on such matters, many of the fishermen have now begun entering several South American nations’ Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), and that is illegal.</p>
<p>An EEZ extends 200 nautical miles from the shore under rules set down by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>
<p>Countries have the rights over the resources within their EEZs.</p>
<p>The close-in Chinese fishing has an impact on local fishermen who traditionally have relied on these waters for their livelihoods and can’t compete with Chinese trawlers and the big ships capable of refrigerating their catch.</p>
<p>The most numerous incursions by Chinese fishermen appear to target Argentina and Peru, although Chinese fishing boats have also been seen near Chile and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Much of what Evan Ellis has had to say about the most recent incursions and possible countermeasures and solutions to address them was first published the website Newsmax on Dec. 13.</p>
<p>Given the high demand for fish from a growing Chinese middle class, China’s distant-water fishing fleet has grown to the point where it reaches many locations around the world.</p>
<p>Much of the Chinese demand is for high-value fish and exotic species such as the now endangered tatoaba fish.</p>
<p>Shrimp and squid and a small species of porpoise which is mostly found near Mexico are also prized.</p>
<p>The tatoaba fish is much valued in Asia for the alleged medicinal properties of its bladder, according to Cliff White, writing for the <i>Seafood Source</i> website.</p>
<p>Totoaba bladders can sell for $1,400 and even as high as $4,000 in China, White reports. Other sources cite even higher prices.</p>
<p>Also endangered is the vaquita porpoise, a species of porpoise that is now estimated to number fewer than 100 because of illegal fishing.</p>
<p>The magazine <i>Dialogo</i> quoted Juan Carlos Sueiro, Peru’s director of the international organization OCEANA, as saying that Chinese illegal fishing has had its greatest impact on giant squid, cod, tuna, sharks, and totoaba.</p>
<p>Dialogo is a digital military magazine published by the U.S. Southern Command, which is part of the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Peru has a capable navy, which can block some EEZ violations.</p>
<p>But Chinese fishing companies have bought into the Peruvian fishing fleet, which gives those companies rights to fish in Peru’s national waters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese fishing group Dalian Huafeng has expanded its presence in those waters through the purchase of Arbumasa, a Spanish fishing company which operates there.</p>
<p><b>Argentina and Ecuador push back</b></p>
<p>Several Latin American countries have used their navies and coast guards to push back against Chinese incursions but not enough to deter many of the Chinese fishermen for long.</p>
<p>In March 2016, an Argentine Coast Guard ship intercepted a Chinese vessel operating illegally in the waters of Argentina’s EEZ.</p>
<p>According to Evan Ellis, who is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College, Chinese vessels had routinely violated the zone, as they had in numerous other countries in the region.</p>
<p>But in this case, the Argentine Coast Guard ship fired a warning shot to halt the Chinese ship’s escape to international waters.</p>
<p>When the ship, the Lu Yan Yuan Yu, responded by trying to ram the Argentine vessel, the Coast Guard ship responded, inadvertently capsizing the Chinese vessel.</p>
<p>The Chinese crew escaped by swimming out to other Chinese vessels.</p>
<p>Argentine Navy submarines were then assigned to chase down illegal fishing vessels off southern Argentina, according to a <i>Wall Street</i> <i>Journal </i>report.</p>
<p>In August, 2016, Ecuador jailed 20 Chinese fishermen for up to four years for illegally fishing in the Galapagos Islands marine reserve, where they were caught with some 6,600 sharks.</p>
<p><b>The bigger picture</b><b></b></p>
<p>It has been evident for the past several years that China’s distant-water fishing has added to stress on the world’s fish stocks.</p>
<p>China accounts for some 35 percent of global demand, according to some estimates.</p>
<p>Its fishing vessels operate not only to feed China’s appetite for fish but also for profit on a wider scale.</p>
<p>According to Ellis, the Chinese deepwater fleet has become a key vendor of fish sold to Europe and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The Chinese fishing fleet has grown to an estimated 3,400 vessels, roughly 17 times larger than the United States fishing fleet.</p>
<p>Until recently, China’s fishing fleet expansion has been supported by government subsidies for fuel and vessel building.</p>
<p>But the Chinese government is well aware of protests from Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere against the damage that Chinese fishing boats have done to foreign fisheries and fishermen.</p>
<p>Toward the end of last year, the government stopped calling for an expansion of the Chinese distant-water fishing fleet.</p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Agriculture released a five-year plan that restricts the total number of offshore fishing vessels to under 3,000 in 2021.</p>
<p>Worth watching in the future are Chinese provinces and fishing companies that would still like to expand their fishing catch rather than curb it.</p>
<p><b>Possible solutions</b><b></b></p>
<p>According to Evan Ellis, the first steps for the region to respond to the challenge of the Chinese deepwater fishing fleet include:</p>
<p>·      Greater public awareness of and documentation of the problem;</p>
<p>·      Greater dissemination of data on the threat by the coast guards and and navies of the region; and</p>
<p>·      Greater attention to the problem by the region’s media.</p>
<p>Ellis says that governments in the region should also raise the issue in a more serious fashion with their Chinese counterparts through multilateral dialogues.</p>
<p>Governments could pursue this though institutions such as the Organization of American States (OAS), and during bilateral dialogues.</p>
<p>Ellis acknowledges that the needs of each of each Latin American nation are different.</p>
<p>But he argues that all of those affected by Chinese fishing could benefit from acquiring more extended-range patrol boats supplemented by maritime patrol aircraft and long-endurance drones.</p>
<p>In his view, the United States would have a potential role to play, both in helping its Latin American partners to obtain those capabilities and by sharing its intelligence with them when appropriate.</p>
<p>Responding to the challenge may also require judicial reform to ensure the prompt and effective prosecution of violators, Ellis says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Peruvian government has made public satellite surveillance data on 1,300 commercial fishing vessels plying Peru’s waters.</p>
<p>The country aims to use the platform called Global Fishing Watch (GFW) as a tool to fight illegal fishing and overfishing.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of a global-scale revolution  in the transparency of industrial fisheries,” said Juan Mayorga, a researcher at the sustainable fisheries group.</p>
<p>“Users of the GFW can detect if a boat is fishing during the closed season or if it sails into a protected area,” said Mayorga.</p>
<p>An example of how the GFW can help combat illegal fishing in Peru occurred in September this year when authorities intercepted a Chinese vessel near the northern port city of Chimbote for not having a permit to operate in Peruvian waters.</p>
<p>Inside the vessel, they found 19 tons of Humboldt squid that had probably been illegally extracted inside Peru’s EEZ.</p>
<p>GFW also enables the monitoring of fishing fleets during the night. Squid fishing is done only at night when vessels shine bright lights to attract squid.</p>
<p>Sueiro of OCEANA said that illegal fishing costs Peru about $360 million a year.</p>
<p>An investigation by the nongovernment organization Oceana Peru revealed that between January 2015, and September 2016, at least a dozen Chinese vessels had entered Peru’s EEZ without Peruvian authorization and had possibly engaged in illegal fishing.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Good News from Beijing: China has decided to postpone a plan to lift a ban on imports of tiger bones and rhino horns.</p>
<p>In a sharp policy reversal on Nov. 12, facing protests from conservation groups, China postponed plans unveiled in October to modify its 1993 ban to allow use for medical research and other special purposes.</p>
<p>For the time being, China will continue to strictly ban the import, export, the sale, purchase, transport, and use in medicines of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts.</p>
<p>“A ban would potentially decrease demand and make poaching more difficult,” says John Gruetzner, the managing director of a Toronto-based, Asian-focused investment advisory group.</p>
<p>“And a ban would certainly make buying the bones and horns more risky and expensive to smuggle and sell,” says Gruetzner, who also advises pro bono a number of conservation groups.</p>
<p>But a number of experts say that regardless of whether a ban is imposed or lifted, an underground trade in tiger bones and rhino horns is likely to continue.</p>
<p>The implementation of a law or a ban in China can often prove difficult, partly due to widespread corruption.</p>
<p>This includes bribes paid to government and Party officials, according to Minxin Pei, a China expert at Claremont McKenna College in California.</p>
<p>In a book published in 2016 titled “China’s Crony Capitalism,” Pei meticulously documented the ways in which Chinese Communist Party officials and their relatives collude with Chinese businessmen to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>While President Xi Jin-ping’s anti-corruption drive has succeeded in sending a large number of high-ranking officials to prison, lower-level corruption is systemic and more difficult to stamp out.</p>
<p>The underground trade in both tiger bones and rhino horns has proven to be a profitable illegal business, driven by a high demand from China’s growing middle class.</p>
<p>Some of the wealthiest members of the middle-class regard tiger bone parts and pelts both as status symbols and as useful for their supposed medicinal value.</p>
<p><b>No scientific evidence</b></p>
<p>Tiger bone powder, sometimes made into tiger-bone wine, is believed to help cure everything from liver and kidney diseases to eczema, epilepsy, baldness, toothaches, and joint pain.</p>
<p>No scientific evidence has been presented to verify any medical or healing value provided either by tiger bones or rhino horns.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t seem to matter to avid consumers that leading medical practitioners in China have discouraged the use of powder made from tiger bones or rhino horns for healing purposes.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 traditional medical practitioners constitute an influential interest group in China.</p>
<p>And they appear to have the support of President Xi Jinping, who has used Chinese traditional medicine as a force to expand China’s overseas influence, according to <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
<p>A recent issue of <i>The Economist</i> provides an example: From Dakar, Senegal, the magazine reports that “Chinese medicine is on the rise in Africa.”</p>
<p>According to the magazine, in one makeshift clinic located in a house in central Dakar there’s something for everyone. Teas for kidney problems, creams for aches, pills for infertility, and four pills claiming to help men with infertility.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Chairman Mao Zedong instigated the killing of Chinese tigers in campaigns to rid the countryside of wide-ranging, cattle-raiding tigers.</p>
<p>As the Reuters news agency has reported, thousands of tigers were killed in these campaigns under which bounties were paid to hunters for tiger pelts.</p>
<p>Once Mao decided to halt the campaigns, many tigers were reduced to surviving in dismal cages and suffered from inbreeding and lower birthrates, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>As the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has reported, in 1986 tigers born in American zoos were shipped to China with the aim of starting a program to conserve the species.</p>
<p>The tigers would form the basis for a new captive breeding program.</p>
<p><b>Commerce before conservation</b></p>
<p>They became the founding population of China’s first government-sanctioned commercial tiger farms.</p>
<p>But they also became for-profit organizations designed not so much to protect the tigers as to slaughter many of them to produce bones for the traditional medicine industry.</p>
<p>Some of the tigers have also served as tourist attractions, where Chinese tourists can view them living in cramped enclosures.</p>
<p>According to the EIA, some 5,000 to 6,000 tigers now live in more than 200 facilities across China.</p>
<p>EIA has done extensive investigative work documenting the conditions in some of these tiger farms.</p>
<p>Captive tigers are also kept in smaller facilities, from “zoos” to circuses and backyard facilities.</p>
<p>Many are kept in cramped enclosures with little to provide them with mental stimulation, and some exhibit signs of several mental and physical distress, the EIA says.</p>
<p>Serious deformities suggest that debilitating inbreeding has occurred.</p>
<p>EIA says that “cruel restraining techniques” allow customers to pose for pictures atop sedated tigers.</p>
<p>Under China’s now postponed plan to lift a ban on imports of tiger bones and rhino horns for purposes of research and healing, tiger farms would be strictly regulated.</p>
<p>But some environmentalists are skeptical of this commitment, given the high profits that can be made through the underground trade.</p>
<p>Over the years the tiger farms have been used as cover to launder tiger parts for sale to customers willing to pay high prices for them.</p>
<p>Gilbert M. Sape, a campaigner with World Animal Protection, an advocacy group based in London, welcomed China’s decision to postpone lifting the ban on tiger and rhino products.</p>
<p>But he said that keeping a ban is “the only way we stand a chance of protecting the future survival of these incredible animals that are already in decline.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wild tigers in China have been hunted down to the point where only a few dozen appear to have survived.</p>
<p>EIA has reported that a tiny population of tigers in the wild survive near China’s border with Russia, with estimates of their numbers ranging from seven to 27.</p>
<p>Russia’s President Vladimir Putin admires tigers and has supported programs to protect the estimated 500 Siberian tigers which have survived extinction in his country.</p>
<p><b>Possible long-term solutions</b><b> </b></p>
<p>One possible solution for China would be a strengthening of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an agreement that has been ratified by more than 180 countries.</p>
<p>In 2007, participant countries at a CITES conference agreed on a decision that tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts or in products, such as tiger-bone wine.</p>
<p>In 2010, at a “Tiger Summit” held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, then China’s then-premier Wen Jiabao spoke of “ending the tiger trade.”</p>
<p>But that pledge was never fulfilled.</p>
<p>John Gruetzner of Intercedent suggests that as a holding measure, CITES get upgraded to pledge that “no wild animal meat, skin, part, or by-product” be allowed to leave any country or be imported by any country.</p>
<p>This, he said, should be the diplomatic goal of the European Union, Japan, Canada, Australia and other G-20 nations.</p>
<p>But he suggests that getting U.S. President Donald Trump or China’s President Xi Jinping to sign on to this might prove difficult.</p>
<p>When it comes to rhino horn imports, criminal gangs in South Africa profiting from the illegal trade may pose the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>While the demand in China for rhino horn is now down from a high point in 2014, this is still a highly profitable trade for African as well as Chinese smugglers.</p>
<p>Wealthy Chinese have come to regard rhino horn powder as a remedy for a variety of maladies, ranging from hangovers to cancer.</p>
<p>But much as is the case with tiger bone powder, no one over the years has produced scientific evidence to support this belief.</p>
<p>In a 15-page report published last year by San Francisco-based WildAid, investigators concluded that while the awareness of the danger of rhino extinction in China has grown, China remains the main source of demand for rhino horn imports.</p>
<p>Heavy trafficking of rhino horns takes place through Vietnam into China, the nonprofit organization says.</p>
<p>Vietnam has strengthened its wildlife trafficking crime laws, but lacks effective implementation.</p>
<p>At the same time, pervasive corruption persists in South Africa along with a failure to prosecute poaching and smuggling kingpins.</p>
<p>Leaders of criminal syndicates involved in the wildlife trade are known to the authorities but have largely gone unpunished, WildAid says.</p>
<p>WildAid suggests several possible solutions</p>
<p>These include among other things:</p>
<p>·      Using existing laws to arrest, prosecute, and punish prominent sellers and end users in China and Vietnam, and not just smugglers.</p>
<p>·      Arresting and punishing organizers and kingpins in South Africa and Mozambique, and not just poachers.</p>
<p>·      Cracking down with an anti-corruption drive in parks and reserves in South Africa.</p>
<p>·      Establishing a “wildlife court” in South Africa to strengthen judicial effectiveness in dealing with wildlife crime.</p>
<p>·      Improving investigative capacities and speeding up prosecutions.</p>
<p>All of this is easier said than done, but it helps to have goals.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China’s decision to lift a ban on rhinoceros horn and tiger bone imports may now make the animals easier targets for poachers and black marketers, a number of wildlife conservation experts say.</p>
<p>The Chinese government said that it is lifting the ban so that approved hospitals can use the imported bones and horns for “medicinal research or in healing.”</p>
<p>In announcing an end to the ban, China’s State Council said on October 29 that only animals in captivity would be used in the research and that this would exclude zoo animals.</p>
<p>Peter Knights, CEO of the San Francisco-based nonprofit organization WildAid, said that “while tiger populations have stabilized, the danger is this policy change could invigorate demand for tiger parts and also lead to an increase in poaching.”</p>
<p>Tiger bones and other parts of the animals such as their teeth have been sought over the centuries in China and several Southeast Asian countries for their alleged healing value.</p>
<p>Tiger parts are said to cure many maladies, and this belief supported an underground trade in poached tigers even while the 25-year-long ban was ostensibly in effect.</p>
<p>Government officials said, however, that the use of imported horns and bones will now be strictly regulated and that tiger bones will come from government-sanctioned “tiger farms.”</p>
<p>Environmentalists have countered that China’s state-sanctioned commercial tiger farms have served to provide cover for the illegal trading in tiger bones, which is highly profitable.</p>
<p>The farms pose a risk, they say, to an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 tigers currently held in captivity in China as well as to the country’s few remaining wild tigers.</p>
<p><b>From cures to status symbols</b><b> </b></p>
<p>In a blog written for the <i>National Geographic</i> in 2015, Sharon Guynup described how over the centuries in China almost magical powers have been attributed to tigers.</p>
<p>Tiger bone powder, sometimes made into tiger-bone wine, is believed to help cure everything from liver and kidney diseases to eczema, epilepsy, baldness, toothaches, and joint pain.</p>
<p>No scientific evidence has been produced to verify this, and leaders among traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have tried to discourage the use of both rhino horns and tiger bones, but to no avail.</p>
<p><i>The Economist </i>magazine<i> </i>recently<i> </i>interviewed Zhu Meng, a practitioner of traditional medicine in Beijing, who was cheering the lifting of the ban on the bones and horns that was imposed 25 years ago in 1993.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu asserted that tiger bone mixed with alcohol can cure arthritis and that rhino-horn powder can help in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease, among other things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as some Chinese have grown wealthier in recent years, tiger bones and pelts have become status symbols, which is another factor contributing to the underground trade in tiger parts.</p>
<p>Tiger-bone wine has become yet another status symbol, with an eight-year-old wine selling for around $290 a bottle as of  2015, according to the writer Lauren Rothman.</p>
<p><b>Promoting traditional Chinese medicine</b><b></b></p>
<p><i>New York Times</i> China correspondent Javier C. Hernandez, reporting on Oct. 29, cited experts as saying that the move to lift the ban on rhino horn tiger imports was likely related to the Chinese government’s efforts to encourage the growth of  traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine, with more than 500,000 medical practitioners, constitutes an industry valued at more than $100 billion.</p>
<p>China’s President Xi Jinping “has used Chinese medicine as a way to expand China’s overseas influence, and his government has promoted it in places like Zimbabwe and Nepal,” Hernandez reports.</p>
<p>In contrast with his predecessors, Xi has been heavily promoting traditional Chinese culture as part of what he calls “the Chinese Dream.”</p>
<p>The Chinese government hopes that Chinese medicine will gain global acceptance alongside Western medicine, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p>Some environmentalists were shocked by China’s decision last month to lift the ban on tiger bones and rhino horns, partly because it appeared to be a step backward from a widely applauded Chinese decision in 2016 to ban all imports of elephant ivory.</p>
<p>One of the strongest statements on the lifting of the import ban came from the Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which said in a statement that the move would have “devastating<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>consequences” and would be an “enormous setback” to efforts to protect the animals in the wild.</p>
<p>The WWF said that even if restricted to antiques for cultural exchanges or research and healing use in hospitals, imports would “increase confusion by consumers and law enforcers as to which products are and are not legal, and would likely expand the market for other tiger and rhino products.”</p>
<p>The science journalist Rachel Nuwer, author of a the recently published book titled <i>Poached: Inside the Dark World of Wildlife Trafficking</i> said on Twitter that lifting the import ban could mean “game over” for the remaining tigers and rhinos in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the word appears to be spreading to people in nations capable of providing tiger bones to Chinese consumers that many Chinese are currently willing to pay high prices to obtain tiger bones.</p>
<p>Only a few days after China rescinded its ban on tiger bones and rhino horns, the wildlife department of the Indian state of West Bengal issued a red alert to counter the possible poaching of tigers.</p>
<p>Jose Louies of the Wildlife Trust of India told <i>The Indian Express</i> newspaper that inquiries from China seeking tiger bone deliveries had been pouring into India since the lifting of the ban on imports.</p>
<p>“Tiger bones are in high demand in China,” Louies said.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 Bengal tigers are believed to have survived in the wild in West Bengal, constituting today’s most numerous of all tiger subspecies.</p>
<p><i>The New York Times</i> reported in a Nov. 4 dispatch from New Delhi published that closer monitoring of tigers, new technology, and stricter wildlife laws have led to a sharp increase in India’s tiger count, from 1,411 in 2006 to an estimated total of 2,500 today.</p>
<p>Still, as Rachel Nuwer has written, “it’s difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Some 100,000 tigers roamed the world in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Fewer than 4,000—some say a few more than 3,800—remain in the wild today.</p>

</div>Rhinos caught in the crosshairs</b><b></b></p>
<p>But protecting rhinos after the lifting of the ban on rhinoceros horn imports could prove to be more challenging in the long run than protecting tigers.</p>
<p>Few rhinos are known to exist in captivity in China.</p>
<p>So the use of rhino horn for whatever purposes in China may encourage more illegal rhino horn imports from Africa, long a source for the underground trade in the horns.</p>
<p>Rachel Nuwer has written that rhino horns “have been used as antidotes and health tonics for millennia, but, thanks to skyrocketing demand, extinction looms for all five remaining rhino species.”</p>
<p>In Vietnam, where the demand has been highest, Nuwer reports in her new book that rhino horn “has morphed into a status symbol, hangover remedy, and miracle cancer cure.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, “China—whose market for rhino horn seems to be quickly growing to rival that of Vietnam—treats rhino horn carvings, jewelry, and whole specimens, as smart investments,” says Nuwer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, South Africa, the main source for smuggled rhinos horns, has a reputation for corruption when it comes to monitoring illegal wildlife trafficking.</p>
<p>Criminal gangs in South Africa have been skilled at bribing officials and smuggling rhino horns into Asia.</p>
<p>And some of the gangs have now come up with a new twist on how to evade the detection of their illegal exports, which are mainly destined to be shipped to Vietnam and China.</p>
<p>In 2017, the nonprofit monitoring organization TRAFFIC revealed that criminal networks of Chinese origin operating in South Africa were processing rhino horn locally into beads, bracelets, bangles, and powder in order to evade detection.</p>
<p>“The emergence of a new market in China is particularly worrying development and poses increased challenges to already over-stretched enforcement agencies,” TRAFFIC said.</p>
<p>According to the <i>National Geographic</i>, South Africa is home to about 80 percent of the world’s rhinos, which are estimated to number roughly 29,000 in total.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the South African government released statistics showing that while poaching was down slightly in 2017, some 1,028 rhinos were nevertheless illegally killed last year.</p>
<p>The slight dip in poaching last year didn’t count for much, and still left the rhinos in critical danger.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>A symposium on Vietnam has turned a spotlight on the country’s oppressed Montagnard minority, whose plight has drawn little attention in recent years.</p>
<p>Speaking on a panel at a Sept. 14 event titled “Vietnam Revisited,” Neil Nay, an ethnic Montagnard and spokesman for Montagnards in exile, described their suffering under Communist rule.</p>
<p>The event was held at the National Archives building in Washington, D.C., and was co-hosted by the National Archives and the Assembly for Democracy in Vietnam, a U.S.-based nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
<p>An audience of some 250 people, including experts on Vietnam’s wartime history and politics, paid close attention to every word spoken by Nay.</p>
<p>This may partly be because many of us are used to thinking of the Montagnards as a tribal people, best known as fighters who sided with the United States during the Vietnam War. Beyond that, most of us know little.</p>
<p>Nay, on the other hand, is a highly educated electrical engineer and U.S. citizen. He’s fluent in English and possesses a detailed grasp of the challenges that continue to plague the Montagnards.</p>
<p>During the fighting that occurred in Vietnam over a 30-year period between the end of World War II and the fall of Saigon in the spring of 1975, the Montagnards were recruited by all sides and suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>According to Nay, the Montagnards lost more than 250,000 men in the many battles that engulfed them.</p>
<p>For a total population numbering between one and two million people, this was a heavy price to pay.</p>
<p>Michael Benge, an expert on the Montagnards who lived in the Central Highlands for six years during the Vietnam War, says that he believes that Nay’s estimate of the losses is credible.</p>
<p><b>A personal note</b><b> </b></p>
<p>I should make clear from the start that this commentator had little first-hand contact with Montagnards during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Much of what I knew came from Gerald Cannon Hickey, a respected Saigon-based anthropologist who devoted much of his life to studying various Montagnard tribes.</p>
<p>As a reporter for <i>The Christian Monitor</i> based in Vietnam, I made brief forays into combat zones in the Central Highlands in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>But I never stayed long enough to meet many Montagnards.</p>
<p>I was a single reporter tasked with covering an entire country, and many things were happening in other regions in Vietnam as well as in neighboring Cambodia.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest battles of the Vietnam War occurred in the spring of 1972 when the North Vietnamese deployed Russian-made tanks to attack South Vietnamese Army positions near the highlands city of Kontum, I had to be there.</p>
<p>I remember flying with a colleague into the city, which had had held out but was still surrounded by the North Vietnamese and subject to their rocket and artillery fire.</p>
<p>After spending a few hours walking around the town and interviewing South Vietnamese soldiers and an American advisor, we got out of Kontum.</p>
<p>I didn’t know at the time that U.S.-backed Montagnard mobile strike forces had played a key role in defending the city.</p>
<p>I know now, thanks to the military historian John Prados, who has written that “the strikers were the backbone of the defense that saved Kontum.”</p>
<p><b>The Montagnards</b><b> </b></p>
<p>I knew enough, however, to know that during the colonial period in Vietnam, the French referred to many of the highlands’ indigenous tribes as “the people of the mountains,” or Montagnards.</p>
<p>The term Montagnard applied to some 30 hill tribes, each of which had its own language and distinctive cultural heritage.</p>
<p>And on one brief trip made by South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu to Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands that I covered in August of 1967, I saw representatives of many of those Montagnard tribes, including the Jarai and Rhade among others.</p>
<p>But Michael Benge explains that the Montagnards had no collective name other than the one imposed on them by the French and later adopted by the Americans.</p>
<p>The Montagnard tribes are mainly of Malayo-Polynesian, Mon-Khmer, and Sino-Tibetan extraction.</p>
<p>Given this background, many of them could be taken for Southeast Asians were it not for their distinctive culture and native dress.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the symposium held at the National Archives last month and the presentation made there by Nay.</p>
<p>Nay filled in many gaps in our knowledge, including important historical background.</p>
<p>For starters, under their colonial rule the French dealt harshly with anyone who opposed them but did allow a degree of autonomy for the Montagnards.</p>
<p>After French missionaries and then officials explored the highlands for decades starting in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the French organized 28 diverse tribes into one political unit under the name “Montagnard people of South Indochina.”</p>
<p>But after the French were defeated by the Communist-led Viet Minh in 1954, a newly established South Vietnamese government abolished the Montagnards’ autonomous political status.</p>
<p>The South Vietnamese government headed by President Ngo Dinh Diem banned the teaching of Montagnard languages, burned Montagnard books and documents, and forced the Montagnards to take Vietnamese names.</p>
<p>Diem also resettled some one million Vietnamese refugees throughout the Central Highlands.</p>
<p>Poor South Vietnamese from the coastal regions of South Vietnam and minorities other than Montagnards then streamed into the highlands.</p>
<p>In many cases they seized ancestral tribal lands while providing no compensation to the Montagnards.</p>
<p>In 1958, the Diem government crushed a Montagnard resistance movement.</p>
<p>When President Nguyen Van Thieu took power in 1965, the situation seemed to get even worse, according to Nay.</p>
<p>Many South Vietnamese tended to regard the Montagnards as “Moi,” or savages.</p>
<p>But the Montagnards had a special relationship with the U.S. Special Forces, or Green Berets, who began arriving in the Central Highlands in small numbers in the 1950s, well ahead of regular U.S. Marine and Army divisions.</p>
<p><b>The Americans and the Montagnards</b><b></b></p>
<p>Many of the Green Berets formed bonds with the Montagnards over the years.</p>
<p>Rebecca Onion, a staff writer for the online magazine Slate, wrote that “the Special Forces and the Montagnards—each tough, versatile, and accustomed to living in wild conditions—formed an affinity for each other.”</p>
<p>Citing Green Beret veterans, she said that their working relationship with the Montagnards “was a bright spot in a confusing and frustrating war.”</p>
<p>The Special Forces provided weapons and training to the Montagnards.</p>
<p>They also organized them into “civilian irregular defense groups” that could move quickly into combat situations as well as detect enemy supplies coming in from North Vietnam.</p>
<p>When the final North Vietnamese offensive of the war began in the spring of 1975, the Montagnards asked for support in resisting the invasion. They had some hope at one point but got no support.</p>
<p>When South Vietnamese Army units, under orders from President Thieu, retreated from the highlands down to the coast of Vietnam, they made no provision to protect most of their Montagnard allies.</p>
<p>With the South Vietnamese Army collapsing around them, the Montagnards were left to fight on their own.</p>
<p>In the end, many Montagnards felt betrayed by the United States, as they had been by others.</p>
<p>From a helicopter I witnessed the South Vietnamese retreat from the highlands, with snipers and artillery attacking convoys of troops and civilians as they made their way to the coastal city of Nha Trang.</p>
<p>In his book <i>The Hidden History of the Vietnam War</i>, John Prados sums up what happened to some of the Montagnards whom American advisors in the highlands had hoped to get safely to Nha Trang so that they could be evacuated.</p>
<p>Ed Sprague, a senior U.S. advisor in the highlands who knew Montagnard leaders well, arranged to get some 2,000 Montagnards to Nha Trang.</p>
<p>But much to Sprague’s lasting regret, the Montagnards stood on the beach waiting for an American ship that never came.</p>
<p><b>The Montagnards under Communism</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Communist government of North Vietnam had included the right for highlander autonomy in its founding platform in 1960.</p>
<p>But once the Communists defeated the South Vietnamese in the spring of 1975, that promise was ignored, and life became much worse for the Montagnards.</p>
<p>The Communists executed some Montagnard leaders while others died in prisons or “reeducation” camps.</p>
<p>They also imposed severe restrictions on the Montagnards, limiting their cultural rights, education, and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Getting any news from most Montagnard-populated rural areas became difficult.</p>
<p>In the years 2001 and 2004, however, the Montagnards made headlines when thousands of them openly protested religious repression and the confiscation of their ancestral lands by the Communists.</p>
<p>Many Montagnards had converted to Christianity and refused to renounce their beliefs even when subjected to torture.</p>
<p>Some of the protestors also dared to call for self-rule or autonomy.</p>
<p>Soldiers and police arrested hundreds of activists and in some cases opened fire, killing a number of protestors.</p>
<p><b>Escaping from Vietnam</b><b></b></p>
<p>Most of the Montagnards who succeeded in escaping from Vietnam and reaching the United States crossed the Vietnamese border into neighboring Cambodia and then moved on into Thailand.</p>
<p>And most of these refugees, some 12,000, now live in North Carolina.</p>
<p>This is partly because they had maintained links with the U.S. Special Forces, which are headquartered in Fort Bragg, N.C.</p>
<p>And many of the American missionaries who lived and worked among the Montagnards during the Vietnam War were were missionaries from the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church and the Lutheran Church, who brought Christianity to the Montagnards.</p>
<p>But escaping from Vietnam was not easy.</p>
<p>The Cambodian government captured many of the Montagnard refugees and sent them back across the border into Vietnam, where many of them were arrested and then brutally tortured.</p>
<p>In a report published in June of 2006, the monitoring group Human Rights Watch (HRW) detailed the brutality.</p>
<p>In response to international concerns, the Vietnamese government then took a few steps to address the highlanders’ grievances.</p>
<p>The government pledged to provide each low-income household in the Central Highlands with at least 200 square meters of housing land.</p>
<p>And it announced that it would temporarily suspend government-sponsored migration by Vietnamese lowlanders to the region.</p>
<p>But despite pledges by the government to stop monitoring or closing down Montagnard religious services, HRW found in 2006 that Vietnamese officials in some parts of the highlands had continued a crackdown on religious rights.</p>
<p>In some areas, the government banned large Christian gatherings unless they were presided over by officially recognized pastors.</p>
<p>In 2009, however, the Montagnards gained considerable attention when, at great risk, they protested Chinese-supported bauxite mining projects in the Central Highlands.</p>
<p><b>Current Conditions</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Montagnards remaining in Vietnam today have at least three strikes against them.</p>
<p>First, many of them sided with the Americans during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Second, they dared to protest openly for land rights and in some cases against Communist rule.</p>
<p>Third, many had converted to Christianity.</p>
<p>And despite imprisonment, torture, and harassment, many Christian pastors and their followers refused to renounce their religion.</p>
<p>Nay summed up the current situation this way:</p>
<p>“The present-day government of Vietnam imposes severe restrictions on the ability of members of its Montagnard indigenous peoples to exercise their cultural rights, to use their native languages, to obtain an education, and to secure reasonable employment opportunities.”</p>
<p>He notes that today some 30,000 Vietnamese students have come to the United States to study.</p>
<p>As far as he can determine, not a single Montagnard from inside Vietnam is among them.</p>
<p>Persistent poverty challenges today’s Montagnards, just as it does the members of many other ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>A World Bank study published in 2013 showed that ethnic minorities make up roughly 15 percent of Vietnam’s population but account for some 70 percent of the country’s extreme poor.</p>
<p>The government has undertaken a number of poverty reduction programs, some of which have been supported by the European Union.</p>
<p><b>Those who escaped</b><b></b></p>
<p>The good news for some Montagards is that they made it as refugees to North Carolina, where, according to Nay, most have been given a warm welcome.</p>
<p>Moreover, Nay says, most of the adult Montagnard refugees in North Carolina have found employment there.</p>
<p>In July of last year, North Carolina Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis drew up a resolution recognizing “the heroic actions of the Montagnards, who fought loyally and bravely alongside United States Special Forces in the Vietnam War.”</p>
<p>Following the “Vietnam Revisited” Symposium held at the National Archives in mid-September, a group of Montagnards joined a rally outside the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 28.</p>
<p>The rally was organized by the Rev. Nguyen Cong Chinh of the Council of the Peoples and Religions of Vietnam and co-sponsored by U.S. Congressman Alan Lowenthal of California.</p>
<p>Nguyen Cong Chinh, an evangelical pastor, had ministered to ethnic minority communities in Vietnam, including Montagnard prisoners and their families</p>
<p>The Vietnamese authorities sentenced Chinh to 11 years in prison in 2011, but he was released after nearly six years thanks to the efforts of Lowenthal, Congressman Ed Royce of California, and others.</p>
<p>One of the speakers at a reception held in the Congressional Auditorium on Capitol Hill was Nay’s father, Nay Rong, who is the executive director of the Montagnard Human Rights Organization.</p>
<p>A total of some 200 to 250 people turned out for the rally, and of that number some 170, or more than half, were Montagnards who came from Charlotte, Greensboro, and Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Montagnard leaders in exile have learned how to better communicate their story, as evidenced by their turnout and statements made at the rally on Capitol Hill.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Although it’s not widely known, turtles have become one of the most heavily trafficked animals among Asia’s endangered species.</p>
<p>According to the Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund (WWF), six of the world’s seven endangered or critically endangered marine turtle species can be found in the Asia Pacific Region.</p>
<p>One example highlights the problem: Asia’s illegal trade in the Black Spotted Turtle is “spiraling out of control,” according to TRAFFIC, a wildlife monitoring organization based in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>A new TRAFFIC study shows that more than 1,000 of these freshwater turtles were seized by police and customs officials over a two-year period, exceeding numbers recorded during a previous six-year study.</p>
<p>The trade is designated as illegal under an international agreement, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, which has been agreed to by 182 governments.</p>
<p>But in the three leading source countries of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, traffickers are still finding ways of hunting down and shipping many black spotted turtles to destinations where they are highly valued.</p>
<p>Leading destinations include Hong Kong and mainland China, the study done by TRAFFIC says.</p>
<p>Several years ago, traditional Chinese views about the alleged medicinal benefits of the black spotted turtles’ meat had created a high demand for them in mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p><b>Unscientific traditional Chinese beliefs</b></p>
<p>In an analysis published two years ago on Mongabay, an environmental website, Erin Crandall described how a newly affluent Chinese middle class had adopted traditional views regarding the value of turtles’ meat.</p>
<p>Mongabay’s headlines summed it up this way: “The threat of traditional medicine: China’s boom may mean doom for turtles…traditional mindset fueling demand for wild turtles, driving some species toward extinction.”</p>
<p>Crandall notes that “for thousands of years turtles have been used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments and diseases.”</p>
<p>Now, she said, thanks to economic growth, more Chinese families can afford to purchase turtles.</p>
<p>And, despite a lack of scientific evidence, she notes, many believe that turtle meat maintains youthful beauty in women and improves sexual performance in men.</p>
<p>Chinese chefs have also had a long history of studying how best to cook freshwater turtles. They seem to agree that to create the best turtle soup, one should cook all parts of a live turtle, or as many as three turtles, including the shell and skin.</p>
<p>Nothing is wasted. One well-known chef recommends that blood, urine, and bile be consumed as beverages.</p>
<p>But now comes some good news from China.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC’s report reveals a new trend: Many of today’s Chinese prefer to keep turtles alive as exotic pets.</p>
<p>In Chinese culture, turtles have long been regarded as symbols of longevity, tenacity, and good fortune.</p>
<p>Some turtles live for 30 to 40 years. And larger ones can even live to be 70 to 80 years old.</p>
<p>And a good number of them manage to survive being packed onto commercial airline flights on their way to new homes.</p>
<p><b>Possible solutions to the trafficking problem</b><b></b></p>
<p>In its report, TRAFFIC recommends that enforcement of anti-trafficking laws be enhanced at identified trade hotspots, such as Karachi in Pakistan, Chennai in India, and various places along the India-Bangladesh border such as Kolkata.</p>
<p>The largest seizure in the group’s study occurred in Kolkata in May 2014, when authorities seized some 1,000 turtles in a single crackdown.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Pakistan has not completely ignored the trafficking problem.</p>
<p>In March, 2015, a “Regional Symposium on Sea Turtle Conservation in Asia” was organized by the Swiss-based International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Karachi.</p>
<p>It was held under a “Saving the Endangered Turtles on Coastal Areas of Pakistan” program, which is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and implemented by the IUCN Pakistan’s Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>Other hotspots include the Dhaka and Hong Kong airports, mainland Chinese and Hong Kong ports, and Thai and Malaysian transportation hubs.</p>
<p>By checking reports of seizures of trafficked turtles, TRAFFIC determined that many had been shipped on commercial air flights.</p>
<p>Research showed that an estimated 47 percent of documented smuggling incidents involved such flights.</p>
<p>So airports are leading hubs in the trade.</p>
<p>Other key recommendations made by the monitoring organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve reporting by nations concerned to CITES in order to enhance the sharing of information.</li>
<li>Improve prosecution efforts and increase penalties in order to deter offenders.</li>
<li>Increase public awareness of the threats to turtles’ survival.</li>
</ul>
<p>TRAFFIC also says that more study needs to be done on Southeast Asian hubs, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.</p>
<p>The group says that over time, researchers noted that Thailand had been heavily implicated.</p>
<p>India, however, is the country credited with the highest number of seizures.</p>
<p>Seizure analysis for the period 2014-2016 shows India accounted for 29 percent of all seizures of all types of turtles, with Hong Kong placing second during that period.</p>
<p>International smuggling rings and organized crime networks are behind some of the trade in smuggled turtles, the TRAFFIC report says.</p>
<p>In 2017, in a high-profile case, Indian authorities arrested a Singapore-based Indian turtle dealer, who was described as the “Kingpin” of India’s illegal turtle trade.</p>
<p>Manivannan Murugeswan was wanted by the Madhya Pradesh forest department’s special task force, which sent a four-member team to Singapore and then flew the trader back to Chennai and presented him before a special court.</p>
<p>Murugesan was reported to have links with smugglers in Thailand, Malaysia, Macau, Hong Kong, China, and the East African island nation of Madagascar.</p>
<p>The <i>Hindustan Times, </i>meanwhile,<i> </i>reported that another smuggler revealed a trafficking network across India that smuggled rare turtles out of the country to hubs in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>On May 15, 2017, customs officials at Malaysia’s Senai International Airport foiled an attempt to smuggle hundreds of endangered ploughshare and radiated tortoises into Malaysia from Madagascar.</p>
<p><b>Good news from Asia and elsewhere</b><b></b></p>
<p>The good news: The world seems to be full of turtle-loving volunteers who are helping to rescue, protect, and nurture endangered turtles and tortoises.</p>
<p>And non-profit organizations are providing solid research pointing to trouble spots where rescue efforts are most needed.</p>
<p>Turtle Survival Centers have meanwhile been established in a number of Asian countries.</p>
<p>Even a poor country such as Myanmar, where a trafficked turtle can bring a relatively high price, a survival association has gradually learned how to raise 175 star tortoises that were recovered from a trafficker’s truck.</p>
<p>The truck was stopped just before it crossed Myanmar’s border into neighboring China.</p>
<p>And in Madagascar, a major source of turtles illegally exported to Asia, a turtle survival center appears to be thriving and building public awareness regarding the need to preserve turtles and tortoises.</p>
<p>In the southern part of the Indian Ocean country, one Canadian and three American zoos plus a conservation fund have been providing grants to bring the area up to international standards for saving confiscated tortoises.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of nonprofit organizations are acting around the world to counter the poaching of turtles and tortoises.</p>
<p>In late May of this year, WildAid, a San Francisco-based nonprofit group, launched  a campaign to reduce the demand for sea turtle products in China.</p>
<p>WildAid released a series of TV messages and billboards featuring popular Chinese actor Liu Ye and his wife Anais Martane to raise awareness of the threats to turtles while calling on the public to stop buying sea turtle products.</p>
<p><b>Simply stop buying turtle projects</b></p>
<p>Speaking at a launch event, Liu Ye said “we can all do something really simple to help protect sea turtles, and that is to simply not to buy sea turtle products.”</p>
<p>Liu said that Chinese should also reduce their use of plastics and keep plastic waste away from coastlines, where turtles can sometimes be found entangled in the waste.</p>
<p>WildAid said that all seven of the turtle species designated as endangered or vulnerable face a wide range of threats, including habitat loss, ocean pollution, plastic debris, and people who eat their meat and eggs or purchase products made from their shells.</p>
<p>WildAid has also partnered with numerous Chinese government agencies to introduce new measures that will both protect the sea turtles’ habitat and reduce the demand for sea turtle products.</p>
<p>In recent years, meanwhile, illegal trade networks have been working around the South China Sea and the border areas of China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The shells they gather from Hawksbill Turtles’ shells are made into jewelry and other items for sale to Chinese tourists.</p>
<p>A WildAid survey of 1,500 people in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beihai, and Sanya found that 17 percent of respondents had purchased sea turtle products in the past, and 22 percent had expressed an interest in buying more in the future.</p>
<p>Many products were purchased upon the recommendation of tour group guides.</p>
<p>Only 57 percent of respondents knew that it was illegal to purchase sea turtle products in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, already threatened by trafficking, habitat loss, and pollution, marine turtles face other dangers associated with warming seas.</p>
<p>But World Wildlife researchers are on the case.</p>
<p>They’ve been tracking turtles by satellite to discover how their migration habits might be affected by higher sea temperatures.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p><span>One year ago, at least 720,000 Rohingya began to flee for their lives from their Myanmar homes to the relative safety of Bangladesh. </span><br/><br/><span>On the anniversary of the unprecedented exodus into Bangladesh, much has been written about the conflict’s causes, including a first-rate investigative report by Fortify Rights released in July 2018 that makes clear this was a pre-meditated plan by the Myanmar military. </span><br/><br/><span>This week an independent U.N. fact-finding team issued a report that found “genocidal intent” and called for senior Myanmar generals to be referred to the International Criminal Court. According to the team’s conservative estimates, up to 10,000 Rohingya were killed during so-called “clearance operations” in Rakhine state. </span><br/><br/><span>More has been written about Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s moral culpability in failing to stop the violence, and trying to whitewash the military’s campaign of ethnic cleansing. </span><br/><br/><span>Even more has been written about the immense human suffering of the more than 1 million refugees living in squalor, in monsoon-wracked refugee camps.</span><br/><br/><span>Yet what’s been missing is any analysis of what the insurgent group known as the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army has done since its ill-conceived attacks on Aug. 25, 2017 created the casus belli for genocide. </span><br/><br/><span>ARSA has repeatedly stated it has a legitimate right to self-defense under international law, and that it simply has been trying to protect the Rohingya population, to get the Myanmar government to give the population citizenship as well as full legal rights and protections. It has denied links to terrorism, or a secessionist agenda.</span><br/><br/><span>ARSA has displayed absolutely no self-awareness of the suffering they have caused.</span><br/><br/><span>What was ARSA thinking when it attacked border guard and security posts in an attempt to capture weapons? The insurgents had already infuriated the military leadership when it killed six policemen in a similar raid in October 2016. The military began to move battle-hardened troops and equipment into the region, while training civilian paramilitaries. </span><br/><br/><span>ARSA intentionally provoked a military with a 70-year history of scorched earth tactics in constant wars against secessionist minority insurgents. The Tatmadaw has never employed a people-centric counter-insurgency doctrine that strives to win the population’s hearts and minds through good governance and development. The UN panel found their response “grossly disproportionate to actual security threats.”</span><br/><br/><span>This was not lost on the Rohingya population, most of whom were subsistence farmers, living in fear after waves of pogroms and sectarian attacks. Few saw an armed campaign as anything but an enormous risk.</span><br/><br/><span>But this is the self-fulfilling prophecy of extremist groups, which see themselves as vanguards for their constituents. </span><br/><br/><span>Marking the anniversary, ARSA issued a statement condemning the “genocidal military regime,” and reasserted the Rohingyas’ right to self-defense: “We will continue our struggle for our right to exist and further strive in our ancestral land and seek justice for victims of Genocide committed by the Burmese Terrorist Government and its Genocidal Military.” [sic]</span><br/><br/><strong>Building on human suffering</strong><br/><br/><span>Since Rohingya were driven into Bangladesh, ARSA has done almost nothing to protect the interests of their people. In September 2017, ARSA announced a one-month humanitarian ceasefire, but the rebels had no capability to resume fighting.</span><br/><br/><span>The Tatmadaw has fortified the border with fencing, landmines, and armed patrols to prevent ARSA infiltration. There has been little, let alone a sustained, insurgency against the regime. </span><br/><br/><span>In early January 2018, an ARSA ambush wounded six soldiers in northern Rakhine. It was the first ARSA operation since August, and has not been followed up. </span><br/><br/><span>ARSA’s primary concern has been to consolidate its power in the camps. There has been a spate of killings of at least 21 community leaders, many of whom were outspoken opponents of ARSA, blaming their actions for the community’s plight. </span><br/><br/><span>Anti-ARSA activists claimed that by April 2018 they had turned over 15 ARSA members to Bangladeshi authorities. This has prompted revenge attacks.</span><br/><br/><span>With rivals eliminated or silenced, ARSA has been focusing on indoctrination and recruitment. And while joining ARSA in the hopes of forcing the Tatmadaw to make concessions may seem quixotic – in the context of the largest refugee camp in the world, where sexual violence and other insecurities exist – membership in a militant group is a rational choice: it accords protection and additional resources.</span><br/><br/><span>It seems unlikely that an armed insurgency will gather steam. Bangladesh has every incentive to quash militancy, in the hopes that it can negotiate the return of the Rohingya. Bangladeshi authorities have tried to stanch the acquisition of weapons by the Rohingya, and they arrested an ARSA leader for organizing in the camps. </span><br/><br/><span>ARSA has objected to the return of refugees. A voluntary return agreement was reached between Dhaka and Naypyidaw in November 2017. To date, few refugees have been willing to return without legal protections. As such, ARSA seems to be settling in for the long haul, building on human suffering.</span><br/><br/><span>Even ARSA’s short-lived propaganda campaign of YouTube videos and audio statements, which emerged in 2016-2017, seems to be in hiatus. With the exception of a few press releases, its leadership has been in hiding.</span><br/><br/><span>Which begs the terrorism question.</span><br/><br/><span>Fighting terrorism has always been the Tatmadaw’s justification. Without offering any proof, they draw a straight line between Harakah al-Yaqin (HaY), the former name of ARSA, to international terrorist organizations, claiming that ARSA seeks to establish an Islamic State. The Myanmar government declared ARSA a terrorist organization in October 2017.</span><br/><br/><span>Myanmar’s concerns were bolstered when al-Qaeda issued a statement in September 2017 in defense of the Rohingya, quickly followed by similar appeals in pro-Islamic State media organs. Neither group has done much of anything to support the Rohingya. </span><br/><br/><span>In a recent speech in Singapore, Suu Kyi parroted the Tatmadaw, arguing that targeting ARSA made the region safer from the threat of terrorism.</span><br/><br/><span>“The danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine remains real and present today. Unless this security challenge is addressed the risk of inter-communal violence will remain. It is a threat that could have grave consequences, not just for Myanmar but also for other countries in our region and beyond,” the de facto Myanmar leader said.</span><br/><br/><span>The irony is that as the conflict becomes protracted, people will be more willing to take more desperate actions. The chief of Malaysia’s police counterterrorist special branch has raised this concern.</span><br/><br/><span>“There is always a possibility that these Rohingya people will be exposed to Salafi jihadi ideology, get recruited and get sent back to Rakhine state to wage this so called jihad war,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said Monday during an international symposium in Kuala Lumpur on counterterrorism.</span><br/><br/><strong>The danger of a radicalized diaspora</strong><br/><br/><span>ARSA has continuously denied links to terrorism. In a July 29, 2018 press release, it reiterated that it had no ties to al-Qaeda, the Islamic State or Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT): “We do not welcome the involvement of these groups in the Arakan conflict.”</span><br/><br/><span>The insurgent group said that it wanted states to intercept militants coming to join ARSA and that it would cooperate with states over counter-terrorism. </span><br/><br/><span>While there clearly is a threat of the Rohingya within the camps being radicalized, in many ways the greater threat comes from the radicalization of the diaspora. Malaysia, which has accepted over 100,000 Rohingya, is acutely aware of the threat. It has arrested both nationals and third party citizens en route to join the struggle in Rakhine. </span><br/><br/><span>But with no end in sight, with both ARSA and the Myanmar government hunkering down, extremism seems likelier. That bodes ill for regional security, and even worse for the Rohingya.</span><br/><br/><i>Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and the author of “Forging Peace in Southeast Asia: Insurgencies, Peace Processes, and Reconciliation.” The views expressed here are his own and do not reflect the position of the U.S. Department of Defense, the National War College or BenarNews.</i></p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Following its moves to militarize its holdings in the South China Sea, Beijing now plans to “saturate” the vast waterway with a “Chinese civil-maritime presence,” according to a new think-tank analysis.</p>
<p>The London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) published the report by Alexander Neill analyzing China’s plans on Aug. 3.</p>
<p>As Neill notes, international concern over China’s new artificial islands in the disputed Spratly Islands has focused on their military utility, including the construction of aircraft hangers and long runways that can accommodate both bombers and fighter planes.</p>
<p>But Neill cites a dramatic example of China’s increasing non-military presence: On July 27, the country’s official Xinhua News Agency announced that a rescue vessel, the Nanhaijiu 115, had left the port of Sanya on Hainan Island to be stationed on Subi Reef, the largest of China’s artificial islands.</p>
<p>Neill says that China’s growing civilian presence, which follows a period of militarization, is likely to result in a rapid increase in the level of Chinese vessels deployed to outposts in disputed areas, such as the Spratly Islands.</p>
<p>But it’s unclear what a growing Chinese civilian presence will mean for the South China Sea’s marine environment, including fisheries, which are a major source of employment and of protein for people in the region.</p>
<p>John McManus, a marine ecologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science in Miami, says that the waterway’s “fisheries are collapsing” due to overfishing and coral reef destruction, which was partly caused by China’s construction of artificial islands.</p>
<p>China’s dredging of sand and gravel and depositing it on coral reefs killed some fish and expelled others from the reefs, where they sought protection.</p>
<p>Given that the South China Sea constitutes one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, pollution from ships adds to the environmental damage.</p>
<p>According to McManus, the decline of the fisheries worries all of the nations involved, particularly because of the implications for huge numbers of potentially unemployed fishers.</p>
<p>Millions of Southeast Asians depend on the sea’s fishing grounds for their food security.</p>
<p>But China claims that based on past history it owns most of the South China Sea and therefore disputes territorial claims made by five Southeast Asian nations—Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Chinese fishing boats, backed by the Chinese Coast Guard, have engaged in numerous confrontations in disputed areas with fishing vessels from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam</p>
<p><b>Why does this matter?</b><b> </b></p>
<p>The University of British Columbia conducted a study in 2016 which concluded that for a relatively small—around 1,158 square miles—patch of the oceans, the South China Sea delivers “an astonishing abundance of fish.”</p>
<p>In 2012, an estimated 12 percent of the world’s total fishing catch, worth U.S. $821.8 billion, came from this region, according to the study by Clive Schofield, William Cheong and Rashid Sumaila.</p>
<p>The fish are essential to the food security of coastal populations numbering in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The study showed that the countries fringing the South China Sea are among the most reliant in the world on fish as a source of nutrients.</p>
<p>“This makes their populations especially susceptible to malnutrition as fish catches decline,” it said.</p>
<p>The fisheries, moreover, employ at least 3.7 million people who would otherwise have few employment options.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly an underestimation, the University of British Columbia study says, given the level of unreported and illegal fishing in the region.</p>
<p><b>Possible Solutions</b><b></b></p>
<p>Carl Thayer, Emeritus Professor at the University of South Wales, has outlined ways in which solutions might be found and how they might lead to cooperative activities among the various claimants.</p>
<p>On Aug. 3, the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Chinese representatives announced agreement on a draft document to be used as a basis for negotiating a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Given the often conflicting views presented by the 11 parties, one might wonder if a COC, which has been talked about for years, will ever materialize.</p>
<p>But Carl Thayer has analyzed the 19-page-long document and finds a number of areas where cooperation might be possible regardless of whether the COC comes into being.</p>
<p>Thayer notes that pending a comprehensive settlement of various disputes among the nations concerned, Indonesia and Singapore have jointly stated that the parties concerned can still undertake cooperative activities.</p>
<p>When it comes to the marine environment, Thayer notes that China proposes in the draft document six areas of potential cooperation, one of which would focus on the conservation of fishing resources.</p>
<p>China would exclude companies from countries outside the region from participating in such cooperation.</p>
<p>In contrast, Thayer says, Malaysia proposed that nothing in the COC should affect the rights or abilities of the parties to conduct activities with foreign countries or private entities of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that since the code of conduct discussions are between China and ASEAN, “they align perfectly with Beijing’s goal of marginalizing the United States.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t up to the U.S. to set a timetable for reaching an agreement, but it isn’t unreasonable for ASEAN to push for one, if they could agree (which they can’t),” Glaser is quoted as saying, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Nelson Report.</p>
<p>Reuters news agency recently quoted a senior Chinese official as saying that it would be unrealistic to set a timetable for a code of conduct, because the issues are complex and involve many parties.</p>
<p>As Reuters explained, “signing China up to a legally binding and enforceable code for the waterway has long been a goal for claimant members of ASEAN, some of whom have sparred for years over what they see as China’s disregard for their sovereign rights and its blocking of fishermen and energy exploration efforts.”</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            
<p>Go to almost any public market in the Philippines, and you can find people selling caged birds as pets.</p>
<p>Many of the birds have been seized from their natural habitats by wildlife traffickers who meet a growing demand for them from Southeast Asia’s growing urban middle-class.</p>
<p>The traffickers illegally ship many of these captive birds from the Philippines by sea to markets elsewhere in Asia, according to Jay <span style="text-align: start; float: none; ">Batongbacal<span></span></span>, a law professor at the University of the Philippines.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC, a British wildlife monitoring network based in Cambridge, reported that a “thriving illegal wildlife trade” from Indonesia to the Philippines had recently “come into the limelight with a remarkable discovery in a Philippine home.”</p>
<p>The monitoring group said that Philippine authorities found 312 birds and mammals on March 12 this year in a home in Pasay City.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC said that the cache proved “significant for its sheer size and the variety of wildlife involved.”</p>
<p>Officials said that most of the species found in the home were destined for the illegal pet trade and were thought to be from the island of New Guinea, which comprises the Papua province of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Among the animals seized were more than 100 cockatoos as well as Red Birds-of-paradise, wallabies, and sugar gliders, which are pocket-size marsupials belonging to the same family as kangaroos.</p>
<p>Four men were arrested at the house in a joint raid by the Philippines National Bureau of Investigations working together with a special group of Filipinos assigned to counter wildlife trafficking.</p>
<p>Indonesia, meanwhile, has thwarted numerous attempts to smuggle wildlife to the Philippines, according to TRAFFIC.</p>
<p>One should also note that most Indonesian songbirds end up well cared for in Indonesian homes.</p>
<p>As Professor Stuart Marsden of Manchester Metropolitan University has written, Indonesians have a centuries-long tradition of keeping these birds in cages.</p>
<p>The songbirds’ popularity in Indonesia became more notable over the past 20 to 30 years, Marsden says, because of singing contests, where hobbyists gather and judges rate the birdsongs.</p>
<p>The nongovernmental organization BirdLife International says that “although the birds may be traded across Asia, available evidence points to Java as an “epicenter.”</p>
<p><b>Indonesia’s biggest challenges</b></p>
<p>It’s illegal to hunt for birds in Indonesia, but experts say that the law is poorly implemented.</p>
<p>A new study by TRAFFIC concludes that 13 of Indonesia’s bird species—including the country’s national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle—are at serious risk of extinction.</p>
<p>The main driver behind this crisis, the study says, is “the enormous demand for birds for the domestic pet trade.”</p>
<p>Keeping the birds as pets is a part of Indonesia’s national culture, it says, “yet the high levels of demand for some species have fueled excessive hunting, with the populations of many rapidly disappearing.”</p>
<p>Other species at risk include the silvery woodpigeon, helmeted hornbill, yellow-crested cockatoo, scarlet-breasted lorikeet, Javan green magpie, black-winged myna, Bali myna, straw-headed bulbul, Javan white-eye, rufous-fronted laughingthrush, and the Sumatran laughingthrush.</p>
<p>Although most of the birds are kept as pets, the helmeted hornbill is the exception.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC says that thousands of them are killed and traded for their unique, solid-bill casques and carved as a substitute for elephant ivory to meet demand in China.</p>
<p>Chris Shepherd, TRAFFIC’s director for Southeast Asia, said that “despite the alarming scale and consequences of the bird trade, governments and conservation organizations often don’t view this issue as a high priority.”</p>
<p>“This hampers efforts to prevent losses,” he said.</p>
<p>Shepherd, who is a co-author of the new study, told the news agency Agence France Presse, that the huge demand for songbirds in Indonesia has also placed the birds in other countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, at risk.</p>
<p>The new study’s authors say that the solution to the bird-trade crisis in Indonesia lies in a combination of better law enforcement, conservation breeding of birds, the conversion of trappers into wardens, and field, market, and genetic surveys.</p>
<p>A European organization, meanwhile, has taken steps to begin “conservation breeding” to build colonies of endangered Indonesian birds for the purposes of security and propagation.</p>
<p>The Threatened Asian Songbird Association (TASA), operating as a body of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA),  has initiated a program of captive breeding of “assurance colonies” in zoos.</p>
<p>This may turn out to be the last hope for some of the species involved.</p>
<p>The good news: In both the Philippines and Indonesia an impressive list of experts and local volunteers are committed to monitoring and protecting songbirds.</p>
<p>The bad news: The demand for the songbirds in Indonesia is so high, that smugglers ship them to Indonesia from as far away as Vietnam.</p>
<p>On Jan. 21 of this year, <i>The Maritime Executive</i> magazine reported that three Indonesian smugglers dumped some 300 caged birds into the sea while attempting to escape from officers of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA).</p>
<p>The MMEA said it believed that the birds were smuggled over land from Vietnam to Thailand and then into Malaysia, which served as a transit point before the birds were to be sent into Indonesia for sale.</p>
<p><b>In China one bird tells the story</b></p>
<p>The story of a single small bird, the yellow-breasted bunting, provides a tale of what can go wrong in the bird trade in China but also what can go right when it comes to fighting it.</p>
<p>Based on reporting from Hong Kong and from southern China, the<i> South China Morning Post</i> (SCMP) concludes that Chinese diners are eating the yellow-breasted bunting into extinction.</p>
<p>In a lengthy article on the subject published on July 5, the newspaper said that only 14 years ago, in 2004, the small bird was listed as a “species of least concern.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the bird, Chinese gourmands developed a taste for its meat, deeming it a luxury item that “bestows medicinal benefits.”</p>
<p>The trade is illegal, so those who hunt for the bird and those who sell it operate undercover.</p>
<p>The bird’s meat goes unmentioned on restaurant menus.</p>
<p>But customers can place orders for the bird in advance, allowing enough time to bring the frozen meat in from off-site storehouses.</p>
<p>China’s Wildlife Protection Act outlaws the hunting, selling, and consumption of wild animals without a permit.</p>
<p>But in the yellow-breasted bunting’s case, the government has failed to halt the underground trade.</p>
<p>The SCMP says that in the end, efforts by the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society and international academics, environmentalists, and bird watchers “may well prove crucial’ in saving the yellow-breasted bunting from extinction.</p>
<p>In recent years, a team of volunteers led by Dr. Wieland Heim, an expert on bird migration at the University of Munster in Germany has been attaching geolocating devices to track the yellow-breasted bunting’s migration and land-use patterns.</p>
<p>According to the SCMP, Beijing bird watcher and blogger Terry Townsend reported last year that live yellow-breasted buntings were being offered for sale on the Chinese e-commerce website Taobao.</p>
<p>Following Townsend’s report, a representative of Taobao’s parent group, the Alibaba Group, which also owns the <i>South China Morning Post</i>, expressed its concern and removed the offending posts.</p>
<p>During wide-ranging migrations, the yellow-breasted buntings spend about three months in China during which many are killed, plucked, frozen, and then sent by road or rail to the south of China to be sold as a delicacy, according to Fu Wing-kan, assistant manager of the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society China Program.</p>
<p>Thanks to the SCMP, we know that when the little birds fly south, they make rest-and-recuperation visits to Long Valley, Hong Kong’s largest swath of agricultural land.</p>
<p>Here an innovative project involving 28 local farmers is contributing to the species’ survival.</p>
<p>The group monitors the birds and provides education about their importance.</p>
<p>Rice paddies are a perfect habitat for the yellow-breasted bunting, and a farmers’ Eco-Paddy Club plants and harvests the rice according to organic principles, generates income to support the project, and receives part of the crop at season’s end.</p>
<p>Wieland Heim’s team has tracked the birds’ winter migration to Myanmar, where the country’s Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association is planning a survey of the yellow-breasted bunting’s presence and studying ways to raise awareness of its plight.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>According to the best estimates, some 100,000 tigers used to roam through parts of Asia.</p>
<p>But that was more than a century ago. Today, experts estimate that worldwide only some 3,800 tigers have survived in the wild.</p>
<p>This marks a slight improvement for the big cats over a low point of some 3,200 five years ago.</p>
<p>According to Ravi Velloor, a veteran editor at <i>The Straits</i> <i>Times </i>of Singapore, more than two thirds of tigers surviving in the wild can be found on the Indian subcontinent, where India and Nepal, he says, have recently made “impressive strides in conservation.”</p>
<p>In those two countries, tiger populations had declined sharply in the past due to poaching, deforestation, and the loss of good-quality habitat.</p>
<p>Of the 13 “tiger-range” nations of the world, seven—Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam—are located in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“Compared with their South Asian peers, Southeast Asia, sad to say, is a laggard,” said Velloor, in a commentary published by <i>The Straits Times</i> last month.</p>
<p>Driving the trafficking and trade in tigers are wealthy Chinese, living both in China and in Southeast Asia, who regard tiger-bone wine and pelts as luxury items and signs of their status. In violation of China’s own laws, they work in complicity with government officials.</p>
<p>According to an investigative report published by <i>The Guardian</i> in 2015, China’s wealthy believe that tiger-bone wine can be used to treat rheumatism and impotence.</p>
<p>When it comes to tigers’ pelts, <i>The Guardian</i> reported that the rich in China place a high value on tiger-skin rugs and stuffed tigers, which are sought as “status symbols among an elite obsessed with conspicuous consumption.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly,<i> The Guardian</i> found that like ivory products, “tiger skins and tiger bone wine are often presented to officials as bribes.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, during President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption in the Chinese military, several tiger pelts were among what <i>The Guardian</i> called “a huge haul of luxury goods” seized when a senior officer, Lt. Gen. Gu Junshan, was put on trial for corruption.</p>
<p>A market for tiger parts similar to China’s can be found in Vietnam, where wealthy patrons of the trade share the Chinese belief in the purported medical benefits of tiger- bone wine, made by steeping the bone in rice wine.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Vietnamese newspaper <i>Tuoi Tre</i> reported that trading parts of endangered animals, including tigers, had gone “rampant” in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Making the situation more challenging, criminal gangs and syndicates have become involved in the trafficking of many forms of wildlife in Southeast Asia, including tigers.</p>
<p>Why should we care about this?</p>
<p>As the Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has explained, saving tigers is a cost-effective means of preserving much that is essential to life on earth.</p>
<p>The tiger is an “umbrella” species, helping to protect its habitat.</p>
<p>Tigers eat herbivores, such as deer and wild pigs, thus preserving the vegetation around them.</p>
<p>“By rescuing them we rescue everything under their ecological umbrella…including the world’s last great forests, whose carbon storage mitigates climate change,” wrote the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Carter S. Roberts, the WWF’s president and CEO in a commentary published in <i>The Washington Post</i> in 2010.</p>
<p>For example, protecting tigers by halting deforestation will also preserve the carbon storage that these forests provide.</p>
<p><b>Extinction in three Southeast Asian nations </b></p>
<p>Debbie Banks, the Tiger Campaign leader for the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), says that in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, tigers are now “functionally extinct.”</p>
<p>This means, said Banks, that the tiger population in those three countries is so small that the remaining tigers are no longer breeding.</p>
<p>Widespread poaching, or illegal hunting, has contributed to this negative outcome in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>EIA said that in Laos, the discovery of three dead tigers in the country’s Khammouane province in January this year underscored “an urgent need for the country’s government to keep its word and shut down tiger farming operations.”</p>
<p>EIA believes that it’s highly likely that the three tigers came from a farm.</p>
<p>Research shows that tiger farms are often used for commercial purposes. Some tigers are on display for tourists, who pay to see them. But others are killed so that their parts can be sold.</p>
<p>Some farms also produce tiger-bone wine for sale.</p>
<p>In China, tiger-farm proponents have argued that tiger farming will relieve the pressure on wild tigers. But it hasn’t worked out this way, with many consumers still preferring wild tigers.</p>
<p>But China’s laws allow for the trade in the skins of captive-bred tigers on farms, which creates opportunities for taxidermists to “launder” tiger parts illegally acquired from the wild tigers.</p>
<p>The taxidermists get licenses to sell, having been permitted to buy the skins of captive tigers, which are available from licensed captive tiger breeding or keeping facilities, including farms, zoos, and circuses.</p>
<p>The government of Laos, meanwhile, made a pledge at an international conference in November of last year to audit its tiger farms, but the audit has yet to be completed.</p>
<p>Debbie Banks of EIA said that despite Laos’s pledge, “tiger farms across the country have been operating with impunity, with no monitoring, inspection, or regulation for years”</p>
<p>Banks noted that it’s not only an audit that’s required of Laos but also investigations to hold those responsible for trafficking tigers to account.</p>
<p>On the positive side, at the end of January, the U.S. government made a move that could result in limiting the sale of tiger parts in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, or SEZ, located in Laos near the country’s border with Thailand.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department declared the Kings Roman Group that runs the zone to be an organized crime group engaged in drug trafficking, money laundering, human and wildlife trafficking, and child prostitution.</p>
<p>An EIA investigation several years ago had revealed an open trade at the casino in tiger and bear parts as well as in captive animals being held there.</p>
<p>The U.S. has thrown a spotlight on the Golden Triangle, but whether or not this leads to a limitation on the sale of tiger parts will now depend on moves taken by the Laotian authorities.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s most populous nation, deforestation and the spread of oil palm plantations on the island of Sumatra have destroyed the natural habitat for tigers and other wildlife.</p>
<p>In a book titled <i>The Extinction Market </i>written by Vanda Felbab-Brown and published last year, the author says that the total population of tigers in Indonesia was then estimated at only 371.</p>
<p><b>The best news out of Southeast Asia</b></p>
<p>The best news out of Southeast Asia in recent years comes from Thailand, where in 2016, officials from the Department of National Parks shut down the notorious Tiger Temple.</p>
<p>The temple was masquerading as a center for conservation, where visitors could pose for pictures with tigers.</p>
<p>During a raid, the authorities confiscated tigers and other endangered wildlife from the temple, which is located in the country’s Kanchanaburi province in western Thailand.</p>
<p>Thai officials found tiger carcasses on the premises and caught a monk trying to flee in a car packed with hundreds of amulets made from tigers’ teeth and fur.</p>
<p>But according to Debbie Banks, two years later no one has been prosecuted for the temple’s trade in tiger parts.</p>
<p>In the latest development, the people behind the Tiger Temple have started building a zoo under the name of Golden Tiger Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>The zoo has yet to be granted a license.</p>
<p>Thailand deserves credit for helping to protect a number of Indochinese tigers, a fast disappearing sub-species that can be found near the country’s border with Myanmar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Thailand’s Hua Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in the western part of the country has become home to the largest population of tigers living in the wild in Thailand. UNESCO lists it as a World Heritage site.</p>
<p>On the negative side, however, Banks says that Thailand also holds between 1,450 and 2,500 tigers in captivity on tiger farms.</p>
<p>Laos has an estimated 300 to 400 tigers on farms, and Vietnam holds nearly 200.</p>
<p>But China outpaces them all, with an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 tigers in captivity.</p>
<p><b>Possible solutions to the problem</b></p>
<p>Debbie Banks sees an urgent need for “far greater action from world leaders to eliminate the market for big cat parts and products.”</p>
<p>China has drawn praise for beginning in 2017 to shut down the illegal trading in elephant ivory that had resulted in the killing of thousands of the African pachyderms.</p>
<p>But Banks say that while China’s President Xi Jinping has taken steps to ban his country’s domestic ivory trade, “there has not been an equally high level of attention on more endangered species such as tigers.”</p>
<p>“If he is serious about the fight against illegal wildlife trade, he will launch a campaign calling for an end to all trade in all tiger and other big cat parts and products, from all sources, wild and captive bred,” Banks says.</p>
<p>Additionally, she suggests legal reforms to phase out tiger farming and the trade in captive-bred tiger parts, the destruction of stockpiles of big cat parts, cooperation with the police and customs officials in source and transit countries, and work with other governments to reduce the demand for big cat parts.</p>
<p>The Singapore commentator Ravi Velloor says that China has already made a start toward improved protection of tigers by working to restore forest cover that had been depleted by an estimated 90 percent by the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>As Vellor notes, in the remaining tiger strongholds in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, “large-scale logging has led to the loss of tiger habitat” and the collapse of ecosystem protections, leading to severe droughts and massive flooding.</p>
<p>Now, he says, restoring the forests has led to a slowly recovering tiger population. And Beijing has announced the formation of nine national parks to protect endangered species and the sources of major watersheds.</p>
<p>These efforts could, of course, be undermined unless China begins to counter the widespread Chinese demand for tiger parts.</p>
<p>Vellor suggests that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has never been known for taking quick action, try to induce China to fund “one or two key ecological initiatives in the region.”</p>
<p>This, he says, could amount to a “soft power play that would supplement panda diplomacy and earn Beijing far more goodwill at the grassroots than the Belt and Road Initiative that is viewed with some suspicion.”</p>
<p>The Belt and Road Initiative, known widely as the BRI, is an ambitious global trade and infrastructure project intended to link China with Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.</p>
<p>But some scientists fear that the BRI may at a number of points cause permanent environmental degradation.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Governments throughout Southeast Asia have launched a war on plastic waste.</p>
<p>But most are still in the early stages of creating waste management strategies and passing laws needed to implement them.</p>
<p>According to the Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., more than half of the world’s plastic waste can be found in five Asian countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>But when it comes to combating the hazards caused by plastic waste, the Southeast Asian nations have lagged behind China, which in January banned all imports of plastic waste. China also banned shops more than a decade ago from handing out free plastic bags.</p>
<p>All of these nations have long shorelines and beaches that have been polluted by plastic waste.</p>
<p>As the Reuters news agency describes it, “Southeast Asia’s plastic addiction blights oceans.”</p>
<p>The website Mekong Eye says that Southeast Asia’s Mekong region is “the world’s single largest contributor to plastic waste in the marine environment.”</p>
<p>According to <i>The Jakarta Post</i> in Indonesia, that country is regarded as after China, “the second biggest marine plastic polluter in the world.”</p>
<p>The newspaper says that an estimated 1.3 million tons of plastic waste is produced daily across the Indonesian archipelago, creating a major threat to ocean ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government has announced a target of reducing maritime waste in Southeast Asia’s most populous nation by 70 percent by 2025.</p>
<p>The government is also urging the public to reduce the country’s dependence on plastic in their daily lives. Plastic is widely used in Indonesia in bags, cups, straws, bottles, and other utensils.</p>
<p>The environmental group Greenpeace has ranked the Philippines as “the third worst polluter into the world’s oceans” after China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>But Greenpeace says that Western consumer giants should take the blame for polluting oceans by selling products packaged in cheap, disposable plastic to Filipinos.</p>
<p><b>China’s impact on Vietnam</b></p>
<p>Businesses in Vietnam have been making a profit through the recycling of waste imported from China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But top government officials are now warning that this practice has come at a high environmental cost, and must end.</p>
<p>According to the website VnExpress, Vietnam’s Environmental Minister Tran Hong Ha told the country’s National Assembly that businesses will have to halt scrap imports because the country isn’t able to deal properly with the waste.</p>
<p>VnExpress said that China’s action in banning certain waste imports in January “left many nations scrambling to find new dumping grounds for growing piles of garbage.”</p>
<p>Vietnam became the biggest importer of plastic waste from the United States in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>But major shipping terminals in Vietnam announced that they will temporarily stop accepting imported waste from June 25 until October 25.</p>
<p>The Tan Cang Cai Mep International Terminal located near the southern Vietnamese coastal city of Vung Tau said recently that the large quantity of plastic waste containers the port had received had caused “troublesome backups and delays.”</p>
<p>Two of Vietnam’s less economically developed neighbors, Cambodia and Laos, have also faced growing pollution problems resulting from the disposal of plastic waste in public places.</p>
<p>The Fondazione ACRA, a nongovernmental Italian organization, says that the average Cambodian household uses 10 times more plastic than its counterparts in more developed economies.</p>
<p>Citing ACRA’s report, the Cambodian English-language newspaper <i>Khmer Times</i> says that many plastic bags in Cambodia end up floating on Cambodia’s major waterways, turning the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake into “a sight to be lamented.”</p>
<p>Derin Henderson, The Asia Foundation’s program advisor in Laos, in a report published last year, said that urbanization and a shift to consumer lifestyles in rural areas is leading to an increase in imported and manufactured products, which are typically comprised of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials.</p>
<p>Sanitary landfills are limited in Laos, and community dumps are poorly managed.</p>
<p>As a result, Henderson said, “the majority of people must come up with their own solutions for waste disposal by burning their garbage or dumping it into vacant lots or into rivers.”</p>
<p>However, an awareness of the environmental impact of leaching hazardous substances into soils and water and health problems caused by the inhalation of the smoke given off given off by burning plastics and other materials, such as batteries, “remains low in Laos.”</p>
<p>In parts of the country, discarded trash ends up clogging canals and polluting rivers and other waterways.</p>
<p>But Henderson provides some good news: Some estimates show that despite a lack of sanitary landfills, recycling and composting could reduce the amount of waste being discarded by about half.</p>
<p>The challenge is to get the word out.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Asia Foundation launched a campaign in Laos promoting waste management called “Love Laos: Keep it Clean.”</p>
<p>The campaign included several school and community projects in three provinces aimed at teaching students and communities about the financial opportunities available from selling materials for recycling and the health benefits of composting their organic materials and using them as fertilizer in their vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>A film festival held in the old royal capital of Luang Prabang in 2016 introduced a short film competition encouraging Lao filmmakers to produce a three-minute video and public-service announcement promoting better ways of dealing with waste management.</p>
<p><b>A wake-up call in Thailand</b></p>
<p>Mike Ives of<i> The New York Times </i>reported on June 5 that hundreds of turtles, dolphins, and whales are stranded every year on Thailand’s beaches after plastic impedes their mobility or clogs their insides.</p>
<p>According to biologists, some of these animals are lifeless on arrival, but their deaths barely registered with the Thai public, which has been largely indifferent.</p>
<p>But the arrival of a pilot whale that washed ashore in southern Thailand aroused some sympathy in Thailand, thanks partly to social media.</p>
<p>The whale was found struggling in a canal after swallowing 17 pounds of plastic waste.</p>
<p>The whale vomited several plastic bags, and Thai marine environmentalists tried valiantly to save the animal, but the whale died on June 1.</p>
<p>A video showing the whale’s struggle and the subsequent rescue effort made headlines not only in Thailand but elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p><b>Plastics on all the world’s shores</b></p>
<p>What’s happening in Southeast Asia is part of a worldwide trend.</p>
<p>In a study published last year by the journal <i>Science Advances</i>, a team of experts reported that the near-permanent contamination of the natural environment with plastic waste has become a growing global concern.</p>
<p>The United Nations has declared a “War on Plastic,” while the G20, an international forum for governments and bank governors, has released a “Marine Litter Action Plan.”</p>
<p>More than 40 countries and municipalities have now banned or taxed the use of plastics.</p>
<p>But in the end there are limits to how much governments, cities, and international organizations can accomplish.</p>
<p>And a quick end is not in sight.</p>
<p>A new study from the University of Georgia published in the journal <i>Science Advances </i>published on June 21 estimates that more than 100 million tons of plastic waste will pile up around the world by 2030, according to a <i>Washington Post</i> summary of the study.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Scientists and environmentalists are warning that China’s vast “Silk Road” global infrastructure initiative could cause permanent environmental damage unless it’s carefully handled.</p>
<p>China’s President Xi Jinping proposed the concept of a new “Silk Road Economic Belt” five years ago.</p>
<p>Since then it’s been recognized as Xi’s signature policy concept, and is therefore considered “too big to fail,” according to one expert on the subject, Randal Phillips, managing partner for Asia with the Mintz Group.</p>
<p>But in an article published recently in the online academic journal <i>Nature Sustainability</i>, a team of European scientists argue that while the initiative promises to “greatly influence global trade,” it may also promote “permanent environmental degradation.”</p>
<p>China has described the project as a revival of the ancient Silk Road, a system of land and sea routes dating back to the Han Dynasty that connected China to the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>Also described as “The Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), the project includes the building of new roads, railway lines, and ports in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the creation of oil and gas pipelines to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 nations in Eurasia, Africa, and the Middle East have so far endorsed the project, which upon completion would involve about two thirds of the world’s population while proposing more than $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>But in the online journal article published on May 15, the authors argue that changes in the ecosystem due to pollution, the spread of invasive species, restrictions on animal movements, habitat loss, and wildlife mortality are all risks posed by the scheme.</p>
<p>Henrique M. Pereira, an author with the Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources in Portugal, argues that the exploitation of oil and gas reserves through the BRI will mean an increased dependence on fossil fuels and high greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>“…Raw materials and fossil fuels use, and increased oil and gas reserves exploitation constitute a scenario of an increasing dependency on fossil-fuel and high greenhouse gas emissions,” Pereira says.</p>
<p>Fernando Ascensao, an author from the same center in Portugal, says that large amounts of raw material will be needed to support the transport infrastructure’s expansion in environmentally sensitive areas.</p>
<p>The article’s authors note that since the 1990s, China has been strengthening its legislation in pursuit of an “ecological civilization,” which would require that environmental assessments precede major economic development activities.</p>
<p>They argue that China can find the right balance between development and environmental sustainability if it implements in the BRI’s foreign corridors the environmental practices already required within its own borders.</p>
<p>The authors cite a recent report published early this year by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) showing that these corridors overlap with 1,737 Key Diversity Areas, or KDAs.</p>
<p>The corridors also overlap with the habitat range of 265 threatened wildlife species, including 39 species that are critically endangered, the Swiss-based WWF says.</p>
<p><b>Questions about implementation</b><i></i></p>
<p>Problems in monitoring the BRI’s implementation could arise, meanwhile, from a lack of transparency among some of the Chinese banks and state-owned companies which will be charged with financing and then building and servicing much of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>In testimony early this year before the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), Randal Phillips with the Mintz Group noted that the China Development Bank (CDB) and China Export-Import Bank (China Ex-Im) will play central roles in financing of the BRI.</p>
<p>“It’s precisely the central role of these institutions that is troubling to U.S. and other foreign officials—and companies seeking to get involved—given the very limited transparency in operations they provide …,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>China’s Action Plan for the BRI says that “efforts should be made to promote green and low-carbon infrastructure.”</p>
<p>But as an analysis published by the Stockholm Environment (SEI) Institute notes, the BRI will be “subsidizing inefficient and energy intensive, high-polluting state-owned enterprises (SOEs).”</p>
<p>Since the SOEs answer only to the government and enjoy state financing, “there has been little incentive for these Chinese companies to carefully assess costs, benefits, and risks,” the SEI report says.</p>
<p>“From the outset, BRI was in part designed to absorb China’s overcapacity in steel and cement production to boost the domestic economy,” the SEI report says. “This perpetuates a carbon- and pollution-intensive model rather than helping the country wean itself from its dependence on heavy industry.”</p>
<p>According to Phillips, when Xi announced the BRI policy, China was “wrestling with its desired response” to the U.S. “rebalance to Asia,” and in particular to the proposed Transpacific Partnership (TPP).</p>
<p>“The relatively vacant space of infrastructure spending provided a ready-made and relatively benign path to do so,” he said.</p>
<p>The maritime “road” part of the plan fits with China’s desire to build the infrastructure to diversify its energy supplies and reduce the risk of being “strangled” in a conflict with the United States, Philips said.</p>
<p>Philips is referring here to long-standing Chinese military concerns that an adversary could easily block the Malacca Strait, a narrow, 500-mile-long trading route between the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. More than 80 percent of China’s oil imports pass through the strait.</p>
<p>Phillips says that People’s Liberation Army planning documents dating back over a decade suggest using alternative energy transmission routes through Myanmar, potentially building a canal through the Kra Isthmus in Thailand and ports in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and beyond.</p>
<p><b>Environmental Impact on Myanmar</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>The construction of roads planned for the BRI could have a major environmental impact in Burma, or Myanmar, according to the report posted on Jan. 18 this year by the World Wide Fund for Nature, known at the time  as the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p>“China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Myanmar highlights that while the BRI presents significant development opportunities for Myanmar it also brings substantial risks for people and Myanmar’s natural capital, including forests, rivers, land, biodiversity and oceans,” the report says.</p>
<p>The report quotes Hanna Helsingen, Green Economy Program and Policy Manager for the WWF in Myanmar, as saying that BRI road building could endanger wildlife and contribute to deforestation, landslides, and pollution.</p>
<p>“Through better planning and design, these risks can be avoided and mitigated,” Helsingen says.</p>
<p>The WWF report focuses on two proposed East-West and North-South road corridors.</p>
<p>If these go as planned, the BRI will cut through parts of Myanmar’s vital Ayeyarwady, or Irrawaddy, River Basin and its surrounding mountains.</p>
<p>The region is the home to some 24 million people. They rely on the Irrawaddy for drinking water and for silt to replenish one of the world’s major rice-growing areas, which is located along its downstream banks.</p>
<p>Under the BRI, Chinese companies would build a deepwater port in Myanmar at Kyaukpyu, allowing them a trading corridor to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar.</p>
<p>This would meet the Chinese military’s desire to find an alternative trade route should an enemy “strangle” China’s trade through the Malacca Straits during a conflict.</p>
<p>But according to a report from Yangon published on June 4 in the <i>Financial Times</i>, Myanmar is reviewing the deepwater port project over concerns that it is too expensive and “could ultimately fall under Beijing’s control if Myanmar were to default on its debt.”</p>
<p>The World Wildlife Fund, meanwhile, is recommending that Myanmar civil society be included at all levels and stages of various project plans to avoid negative social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The nongovernmental organization also recommends that more assessments be undertaken before BRI road building begins in order to better understand risks related to floods, erosion, and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The BRI design, it says, should “enhance environmental, social and economic benefits, including buffer zones, re-vegetation of slopes, and wildlife corridors.”</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China recently has been threatening Taiwan with artillery drills and bombers flying near the self-governing island.</p>
<p>But according to some analysts a more serious threat to Taiwan may turn out to be Beijing’s attempts to subvert democracy there.</p>
<p>This would involve, among other things, encouraging splits among the island’s people that would work to China’s advantage.</p>
<p>J. Michael Cole, chief editor of the <i>Taiwan Sentinel</i>, summed this up well when he wrote that “instead of trying in vain to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese as part of its effort to engineer the unification of China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has…abandoned that strategy.”</p>
<p>Instead, Cole said, the CCP is “now intensifying efforts to corrode and undermine Taiwan’s democratic institutions, create social instability, further isolate Taiwan internationally, and hollow out Taiwan’s economy by attracting its talent.”</p>
<p>Beijing regards democratic and self-governing Taiwan as part of its territory, a breakaway province that must return to the motherland.</p>
<p>According to Cole, the key reason for China’s shift to a subversion strategy is the failure of an eight-year-long attempt by China “to shape Taiwanese self identification and support for unification through various economic incentives and various acts self-described as ‘goodwill.’”</p>
<p>That approach had the counterproductive effect of strengthening a trend in Taiwan for its people to identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, an identity that has been highlighted repeatedly in public opinion polls in Taiwan.</p>
<p>And in elections for both the executive and legislative branches of government 2016, Taiwan’s voters came out in favor of a return to power of what Cole calls the “Taiwan-centric” Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</p>
<p><b>China’s unhappiness with Taiwan’s new president</b></p>
<p>For eight years, from 2008 to 2016, Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeou pursued a policy of rapprochement with Beijing.</p>
<p>So China was clearly unhappy when Taiwan’s new president Tsai Ing-wen took power in May of 2016.</p>
<p>Beijing sees Tsai as a proponent of independence for the Taiwan and its more than 23 million people.</p>
<p>Though Tsai has been careful not to speak openly about independence, she hasn’t supported the conciliatory China policy pursued by her Nationalist Party predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou.</p>
<p>Tsai’s ruling DPP has also declined to endorse a so-called consensus reported to have been agreed to in 1992 by China and Taiwan when the island was ruled by the Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>DPP supporters contend that there’s little documentation to show that any consensus was agreed upon.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tsai has taken a pragmatic approach by calling for a continuation of the status quo with China.</p>
<p>Beijing has cut off contacts with Taiwan that had been established during Ma Ying-jeou’s presidency and has been using a variety of means to pressure its government and, sometimes under cover, to influence its people.</p>
<p>In 2017, China intensified its efforts to get nations that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan to break off their ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>These efforts had ceased when Ma Ying-jeou was in power under a kind of tacit agreement by China to ease pressure in the diplomatic realm.</p>
<p><b>How PRC subversion works</b></p>
<p>Russell Hsiao, executive director of the U.S.-based think tank Global Taiwan Initiative, has outlined how a policy of subverting Taiwan’s democratic system might work.</p>
<p>In testimony last month before the congressionally funded U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), Hsiao said that China had already adopted subversion tactics in the 1980s, when Taiwan began moving from a dictatorship under martial law to a democratic system.</p>
<p>He described such tactics as part of the Communist Party’s United Front policy of “forming alliances with non-communist masses against a common enemy” that dates back to the 1920s.</p>
<p>According to New Zealand scholar Anne-Marie Brady, “United Front activities incorporate working with groups and prominent individuals in society; information management and propaganda; and it has also frequently been a means of facilitating espionage.”</p>
<p>China’s leader Xi Jinping gave a speech in 2014 on the importance of United Front work, calling it one of the Communist Party’s “magic weapons.”</p>
<p>As Hsiao explains it, given the history of the Chinese civil war between the Communists and Nationalists and the strategic importance of Taiwan for the Communist Party’s leaders, Taiwan remains “the United Front’s number one priority.”</p>
<p>After the People’s Republic of China (PRC) took the Republic of China’s seat in the United Nations in 1971, Beijing’s objective evolved into the incorporation of Taiwan into the PRC under a formula described as “One Country, Two Systems.”</p>
<p>That formula, rejected at the time by the Nationalist government, was applied to Hong Kong and remains until today the blueprint for the Communist Party since it was first proposed by China’s supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, says Hsiao.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hsiao says, nonmilitary actions by China that take place in a “grey zone of conflict falling beneath the level of warfare” possess the “most coercive potential against Taiwan.”</p>
<p>China’s nonmilitary tools include economic coercion, political influence, clandestine measures, information operations such as propaganda and disinformation, and the use of noncommunist proxies in Taiwan who act motivated by self interest rather than ideology.</p>
<p>China’s efforts to get Taiwan’s diplomatic allies to break their ties with the island and switch their recognition to Beijing can have a psychological effect.</p>
<p>Since the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president of Taiwan in 2016, China has intensified its anti-Taiwan diplomatic offensive.</p>
<p>On May 24, the West African nation of Burkina Faso cut its ties with Taiwan, ending a 24-year-long relationship with Taipei only a few weeks after the Dominican Republic severed its relations with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan now has only 18 diplomatic allies around the world compared with 22 when Tsai was elected president.</p>
<p>In a televised statement, Tsai criticized Beijing for its “dollar diplomacy” and said that Taiwan would “no longer be forbearing” and would instead become more determined in seeking international partnerships.</p>
<p>But as Hsiao explains, “the continued bleeding of diplomatic allies could lead to lower public confidence and morale in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Beijing is also using its influence to exclude Taiwan from international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.</p>
<p><b>Recruiting Taiwan’s young people</b></p>
<p>According to Russell Hsiao, the student-led “Sunflower Movement” on Taiwan in the spring of 2014 caused a rethink in Beijing’s approach to United Front work against Taiwan.</p>
<p>Student protesters occupied Taiwan’s Legislature for 23 days in opposition to a trade agreement which the island’s government had drawn up with China without what many considered to be adequate consultation.</p>
<p>Beijing found that high-level exchanges with Taiwan had done little to change pro-independence views on the island. Therefore, Hsiao says, China shifted its United Front strategy to focus on targeting small and medium-sized enterprises, middle to low income people, regions outside of the capital Taipei, and Taiwan’s youth.</p>
<p>Targeted groups also included aboriginals, distant relatives, fishermen’s associations, religious organizations, pro-China political parties, Chinese spouses, and retired Taiwan Army military officers, some of whom have been willing to provide sensitive military information in return for bribes provided by Beijing operatives.</p>
<p>In a report written for the U.S.-based Jamestown Foundation, China scholar Peter Mattis wrote that in 2009 then President Ma Ying-jeou “opened the flow of people and businesses across the strait without consulting security officials on how to manage the risks.”</p>
<p>This brings up another issue: An estimated 300,000 Chinese wives in Taiwan with passports from China are reported to include many who are associated with pro-unification groups.</p>
<p>Chinese businesses go through local pro-China legislators in Taiwan to purchase local fish products, making some local industries beholden to China and its interests, according to Russell Hsiao.</p>
<p>In an effort to attract Taiwanese high school graduates, China offers them subsidies to study at Chinese universities and to stay on and work there if they like.</p>
<p>This can be particularly appealing at a time when wages remain stagnant in Taiwan and openings for well-paying jobs are limited.</p>
<p>At the same time, China’s economy has been growing much faster than Taiwan’s in recent years, thus opening up more opportunities to start up small businesses in China.</p>
<p>Michael Holtz of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> reported last month from China’s southeastern city of Fuzhou on Beijing’s efforts to win over young Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Fuzhou is located on the western side of the Taiwan Strait and only 155 miles from Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.</p>
<p>According to Holtz, in February Beijing introduced 31 new policies aimed at making it easier for Taiwanese to invest, study, and work on the mainland.</p>
<p><b>The U.S. Connection</b></p>
<p>As Russell Hsiao notes, Beijing attempts to use United Front activities to weaken Taiwan’s relationship with the United States, its main security partner.</p>
<p>Chinese propaganda presents China as Taiwan’s natural partner for cultural and ethnic reasons, despite the fact that Taiwan and the U.S. share an interest in supporting democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>On March 17, President Donald Trump angered Beijing by signing legislation known as the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages U.S. officials to visit Taiwan.</p>
<p>The U.S. has unofficial ties with Taiwan and provides the island with defensive weapons.</p>
<p>Trump also upset Beijing by authorizing U.S. companies to sell to Taiwan technology needed to renovate the island’s aging submarine fleet, the oldest such submarine fleet in the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, U.S. technology will now support Taiwan’s development of new submarines.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>It may come as a surprise to many to discover that a lowly anteater tops the list of the world’s most trafficked endangered mammals.</p>
<p>The pangolin, also known as a scaly anteater, can vary in size from only 12 to 39 inches long.</p>
<p>But the small creatures can fight off animal predators with their sharp claws and scales that act as a kind of armor.</p>
<p>Pangolins, however, possess little defense against human predators.</p>
<p>A rising demand in China for the meat and scales of pangolins reached the point several years ago that all eight varieties of the animal were deemed vulnerable or critically endangered.</p>
<p>According to the Swiss-based International Union For Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pangolins account for as much as 20 percent of all illegal wildlife trade.</p>
<p>The IUCN says that more than a million pangolins were poached in the decade prior to 2014.</p>
<p>Thanks to conservationists and nongovernmental organizations, both local and international, we now know more about pangolins than might be expected.</p>
<p>An IUCN Species Survival Commission formed a pangolin specialist group in 2012, comprising 100 experts from 25 countries and hosted by the Zoological Society of London.</p>
<p>The commission also coordinated an annual pangolin awareness day, World Pangolin Day, in mid-February, starting in 2014.</p>
<p>Pangolins can be found in a number of countries in Asia, including China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others.</p>
<p>In Africa, the east-central African nation of Uganda appears to be a leading supplier.</p>
<p>The trade is highly profitable.</p>
<p>Smugglers can purchase pangolins at low prices in Uganda, for example, and then sell them at high prices in Asia.</p>
<p>Experts say that most trafficked pangolins get shipped by smugglers either to China or to Vietnam.</p>
<p>In both countries, the animals’ scales are prized for their alleged medicinal value.</p>
<p>According to at least one media report, pangolin scales have also been used as fashion accessories.</p>
<p>Pangolin meat, meanwhile, is considered an exotic luxury food.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, some restaurants serve the meat as their most costly delicacy.</p>
<p>At one Ho Chi Minh City restaurant, advance booking for pangolin dishes is reported to be required.</p>
<p>In 2016, an international body in charge of regulating wildlife trading worldwide took the strongest possible action to ban pangolin poaching, trafficking, and sales.</p>
<p>All 182 member nations belonging to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) voted in favor of the ban.</p>
<p><b>Hong Kong slow to move</b></p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has been cracking down on the trade.</p>
<p>And on Jan. 1 this year, Vietnam amended its penal code to increase the maximum prison sentence for illegal wildlife trafficking from seven to 15 years.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the trafficking of pangolins as well as rhinoceros horns, Vietnam has been slow to implement its pledges or to impose the maximum sentences.</p>
<p>According to a CNN report in 2014, Vietnam had only a limited capability to deal with rescued pangolins.  Activists working to halt the trade and care for captured pangolins had “vastly inadequate support,” the report said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has also been lax in implementing penalties.</p>
<p>Many citizens in Hong Kong apparently believe that pangolin scales have medical uses, although there is no scientific evidence to support this belief.</p>
<p>Pangolins have a thick layer of protective scales made from keratin, the same material that makes up human fingernails.</p>
<p>Users boil the pangolin hide to remove the scales then dry and roast them.</p>
<p>On March 22, reporters from the French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that despite the international ban, Hong Kong shops were still selling pangolins scales, sometimes from behind stacks of boxes containing other goods.</p>
<p>One salesman selling the scales for $108 for only 40 grams claimed that the scales when boiled and then fried could remove toxins.</p>
<p>The scales can cost more than $3,000 for one kilogram on the black market.</p>
<p>As the AFP noted, Hong Kong has a reputation for trading in the body parts of several banned or endangered animals, including elephant ivory, shark fins, rhino horn, and tigers’ pelts and teeth.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong customs officials have now stepped up their actions against pangolin smugglers.</p>
<p>According to official reports, seizures of smuggled pangolins in Hong Kong rose from 1.4 tons in 2016 to 7.7 tons in 2017. The pangolins came from Africa.</p>
<p>In December last year, Hong Kong customs officers pursued a gang of smugglers for two hours as they tried to enter mainland China. One smuggler, a Hong Kong citizen, was arrested.</p>
<p>Across the border from Hong Kong inside China’s Guangdong Province, AFP reporters interviewed shopkeepers who said that they feared trouble from the authorities if they sold pangolin scales there.</p>
<p>The illegal trade in pangolins is reported to be widespread in Indonesia, where 31,000 pangolins were seized between 2007 and 20015.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Malaysia, Thailand, and Uganda, some 21,000 pangolins were reported to have been confiscated during the same period.</p>
<p>Indonesia has declared bans on the hunting and trading of the endangered animals, while threatening harsh penalties for violators.</p>
<p>But as elsewhere, enforcement in Indonesia is the problem, with insufficient funds dedicated to regulating the trade.</p>
<p><b>Pangolin publicity problem</b></p>
<p>Endangered pangolins have gained much less international attention than the elephants and rhinos who have been killed for their much sought-after tusks and horns.</p>
<p>According to some experts, these big animals possess a kind of charisma unfortunately lacking in the smaller anteaters.</p>
<p>Pangolins are nocturnal, making them difficult to observe in their natural habitats.</p>
<p>In captivity, they’re susceptible to disease and depression, so pangolins are rarely to be found in zoos.</p>
<p>An exception can be seen in Taiwan, where pangolins have been treated as small superstars, taken into zoos, restored to good health when injured, and returned to the wild when possible.</p>
<p>In the United States, the only pangolin on display in an American zoo died on Oct. 4, 2016.</p>
<p>Baba, a white-bellied tree pangolin who lived in a zoo in San Diego, had lived to be about 10 years old.</p>
<p>He was one of the longest-lived of his kind ever recorded, according to the <i>San Diego Tribune </i>newspaper.</p>
<p>Some pangolins live in underground burrows and some, like Baba, live in trees.</p>
<p>The <i>Tribune </i>reported that Baba was brought to the zoo in 2007 after fish and wildlife officials intercepted him in an illegal shipment.</p>
<p>Near death, Baba was nursed back to health and lived in the children’s zoo, where “he became a beloved ambassador for his species,” according to zoo officials who issued a statement following he pangolin’s death.</p>
<p>Baba, the officials said, “will be greatly missed by all who knew him.”</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China deserves credit for shutting down the illegal trading in elephant ivory that has contributed in recent years to the killing of thousands of African pachyderms.</p>
<p>But much credit should also go to international nongovernment organizations that have championed the elephants’ cause and raised public awareness of it in China.</p>
<p>On Dec. 31, 2017, China, the world’s largest ivory market, banned all domestic ivory sales.</p>
<p>John Gruetzner, the managing director of Intercedent, a Toronto-based, Asian-focused investment advisory group, said that the Chinese government’s decision to halt the trade was partly “a response to global pressure, including pressure from the United States."</p>
<p>But, says Gruetzner, the decision also came as a result of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive as well as pushback from African nations.</p>
<p>According to Gruetzner, Chinese government indifference in recent years had permitted the carving of elephant ivory that contributed to the killing of some 33,000 African elephants a year.</p>
<p>Driving the demand for ivory in China have been members of a growing Chinese middle class who in the past could never have afforded to purchase carved ivory decorations. This was a luxury that was reserved in past generations for a rich minority.</p>
<p>Peter Knights, the CEO of WildAid, a San Francisco-based group, described China’s ban on ivory as “the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching.”</p>
<p>The announcement of the ban led almost immediately to the closing of 172 ivory-carving factories and retail shops in China.</p>
<p>Poaching in Kenya also went down from 390 elephants killed in 2013 to 46 reported last year, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service.</p>
<p><b>The Yao Ming Effect</b></p>
<p>In 2013, WildAid launched a campaign to reduce consumer demand for ivory that featured Yao Ming, China’s famous basketball star.</p>
<p>WildAid produced a documentary film on a trip that Yao Ming made to Africa.</p>
<p>An image of the seven-and-a half-foot tall Yao walking with a small African baby elephant following behind him has proven unforgettable.</p>
<p>WildAid’s campaign surveys showed that awareness levels in China and around the world had increased significantly following the 2013 campaign launch, according to John Baker, chief program officer for WildAid.</p>
<p>Chinese media and nearly 100 worldwide celebrities around the world, including Britain’s Prince William, have joined the cause.</p>
<p>Early this year, Hong Kong lawmakers voted to ban the ivory trade in a city that has been a hub for the trade for more than 150 years.</p>
<p>In the meantime, several governments appear to be following China’s example.</p>
<p>Thailand has drafted laws that would strengthen its protection of wildlife.</p>
<p>And on Jan. 20, Thai authorities arrested Boonchai Bach, head of a major wildlife trafficking network.</p>
<p>However, the outcome of a planned trial of the trafficking kingpin remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Taiwan is reviewing its regulations and vows to ban all domestic ivory sales effective Jan. 1, 2020. Violators will face prison sentences and heavy fines.</p>
<p>Vietnam has also reshaped its regulations, including heavier penalties for those caught smuggling ivory, rhino horn, and endangered wildlife into the Southeast Asian country.</p>
<p>On Jan. 1 this year, Vietnam amended its penal code to increase the maximum prison sentence for illegal wildlife trafficking from seven to 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Demand for rhino horn</b></p>
<p>But while China has made great progress in shutting down the ivory trade, the illegal trade in rhino horn continues to be a major problem, particularly in Vietnam.</p>
<p>According to The Economist magazine, demand for rhino horn leapt in Vietnam following rumors that a government minister had been cured of cancer by consuming rhino horn.</p>
<p>Rhino horn is believed by some Vietnamese to act as a medicine or an aphrodisiac, although there is no scientific evidence that it has such an effect or that it has any medicinal value at all.</p>
<p>Rhino horn is made of keratin, a protein found in human hair and fingernails. So purchasers could enjoy the same alleged benefits by chewing on their fingernails.</p>
<p>Until recently at least, Vietnamese officials have been noted for their lax implementation of laws that might limit the trade in rhino horn.</p>
<p>But in a possible sign of progress, on March 20 of this year a Vietnamese court handed a 13-month prison sentence to Nguyen Mau Chien, the suspected kingpin of a network that smuggled elephant ivory and rhino horn into Vietnam from Africa.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese NGO Education for Nature (ENV), however, questioned whether a 13-month sentence was sufficient punishment for the alleged leader of a major criminal network linked to the killings of hundreds of African rhinos and elephants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some ivory continues to be smuggled into Vietnam.</p>
<p>Witnesses say that Chinese carvers can be found in Vietnam training Vietnamese in the art of ivory carving, and Chinese tourists visiting Vietnam carry carved ivory back to China with little apparent impediment.</p>
<p><b>Mistreated in Myanmar</b></p>
<p>The mistreatment of elephants and the trafficking of ivory and other body parts in Myanmar is less well known internationally than the cases linking China with the loss of elephants in Africa.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some of the media in Myanmar have reported extensively on a number of cases.</p>
<p>And international nonprofit organizations, such as the British-based Elephant Family, are actively working to combat the trafficking.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches kindness toward all living beings, and the vast majority of Burmese are Buddhists.</p>
<p>But the growth in demand for elephant parts used in traditional medicine in China in recent years has led to a rise in number of elephants in Myanmar being killed.</p>
<p>The killing of elephants in Myanmar increased sharply in 2010, with 112 wild elephants reported to have been killed, according to the country’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Conservation.</p>
<p>Since then the type of elephant body parts in demand has expanded from trunks to feet, skin, and penises, all of them considered to be effective, without scientific evidence, as medicines.</p>
<p>Elephant hide, meanwhile, has gained a reputation for treating eczema.</p>
<p>The skin is ground into powder and sold to cure stomach ailments. It can also be turned into prayer beads, bracelets, and pendants.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the demand for elephant skin may now become an even bigger threat to the survival of elephants than the demand for tusks, and poachers in Myanmar are beginning to target any elephant, including the young.</p>
<p><b>Trafficking ban ignored</b></p>
<p>In the meantime, Myanmar’s ban on wildlife trafficking appears to be widely ignored.</p>
<p>The main trafficking route for the wildlife trade used to pass from Mandalay through Lashio and across into China from the Burmese town of Muse, located near the Myanmar-China border.</p>
<p>Some years ago, this commentator wandered around a Burmese town near Myanmar’s border with Thailand.</p>
<p>It was easy to find animal body parts, including tiger pelts, being sold openly there.</p>
<p>Though the Myanmar government later began cracking down on the wildlife trade in Muse, traffickers have adapted by seeking alternative routes to China.</p>
<p>South of Muse, one can find several other border crossings from Myanmar into southwest China.</p>
<p>Sadly, for a country that prizes albino, or white, elephants as symbols of good fortune, the torture of some elephants is reported to reach extremes.</p>
<p>According to a report cited by The Guardian, in 2014, wild elephants were being captured in Myanmar and mentally broken down through beatings as traffickers sought to profit from sales of elephants to tourist parks in Thailand.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that within a matter of a few years wild elephants could become extinct in Myanmar.</p>
<p><b>'Elephant skinning'</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a report released in Bangkok on May 1, conservationists with the group Elephant Family urged countries to completely ban the importation of elephant skin or hide.</p>
<p>While China has earned praise for its ban on ivory trading, Elephant Family expressed concern that China’s State Forestry Administration appears to have issued licenses for the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin.</p>
<p>According to a recent report in the Nikkei Asian Review, the Swiss-based World Wide Fund for Nature warned that “elephant skinning” may have already spread to Thailand, India, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>One possible solution would be a strengthening of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), an agreement that has been ratified by more than 180 countries, including  Thailand, India, Laos,  Cambodia, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Finally, the attention of some conservationists has now shifted to Japan, which is reported to continue to have a weakly regulated ivory trade.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Sand has become a hot commodity needed to support construction work in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The demand for sand has sharply driven up prices for sand in recent years, drawing the attention of unscrupulous local officials, businessmen, and sand-dredging companies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sand dredging has damaged the environment in several countries by disrupting sediment flows and fishing grounds.</p>
<p>Vietnam is a prime example of what can go wrong.</p>
<p>Experts say that Vietnam may soon run out of the sand that it needs to build both housing and highways. But estimates vary as to how quickly this might occur.</p>
<p><i>The Global Construction Review </i>(CBR) reported in October, 2017 that Vietnam was exploring ways to produce artificial sand after some experts warned that it could run out of the naturally occurring material within five years.</p>
<p>According to scientists from Vietnam’s Institute of Transport Science and Technology, Vietnam needs about 100 million cubic meters of sand every year to keep pace with the country’s steady growth rate.</p>
<p>Vietnam may run out of sand as soon as 2020 if dredging for sand exports continues, according to other government experts.</p>
<p><b>Focus on Singapore </b></p>
<p>Most of the sand dredged in Vietnam has been shipped to Singapore, which has used sand extensively for land reclamation.</p>
<p>In early 2011, the<i> International Dredging Review </i>(IDR), which provides news on the worldwide dredging industry, noted that Singapore had benefited from its reputation for fostering an open and corruption-free economy.</p>
<p>“But Singapore’s insatiable demand for sand is fueling charges of wrecked ecosystems, involvement by criminal organizations, and official corruption across Asia,” said David Murray, the author of the IDR report.</p>
<p>The corruption included a “sex-for-sand” scandal, he<i> </i>said, but he didn’t provide details regarding the alleged scandal.</p>
<p>Over five decades, Singapore had increased its land area by an estimated 20 percent. The city-state’s Changi Airport is built on reclaimed land.</p>
<p>Singapore’s government has denied any knowledge of corrupt activities in overseeing sand deals and dredging permits.</p>
<p>But credible reports about sand-dredging which has caused environmental damage in Southeast Asia have raised questions about the city state’s reputation for being green and clean.</p>
<p><b>Vietnam’s failure to protect the environment</b></p>
<p>Despite official Vietnamese crackdowns on illegal sand exports, enough corrupt local Vietnamese officials still look the other way to allow tens of thousands of cubic meters of sand to be exported per day, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Not every kind of sand works well in land reclamation. Sand from a desert, for example, won’t work. A desert’s wind-worn sands are too smooth to work. But certain types of sand from Vietnam and Cambodia seem to meet Singapore’s requirements</p>
<p>The sand dredging has exacerbated environmental damage done in recent years to the Mekong River Basin and its fisheries.  Millions of Vietnamese and Cambodians rely on the Mekong region’s fish as their main source of protein.</p>
<p>The dredging is occurring in numerous rivers and estuaries in Vietnam but most intensively in central Vietnamese provinces, including Quang Bin, Quang Tri, Ha Tinh, Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Thua Thien-Hue, Binh Thuan, and Ninh Thuan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while Vietnam’s media are heavily controlled, a number of Vietnamese newspapers and websites do investigative work, and one of them has reported extensively on the dredging issue.</p>
<p><i>Tuoi Tre</i> (Youth), a popular Vietnamese newspaper, published an investigative series in March of last year, which showed how the illegal sand trading system works.</p>
<p>The series, entitled “Tracing the Vietnamese sand drain to Singapore,” reported that “quite a few” Vietnamese companies were taking advantage of sand privileges authorized by the Vietnamese government to make huge illegal profits.</p>
<p>At the end of 2009, the government banned sand exports, but in 2013 it loosened the regulation, allowing entrepreneurs to export sand from sea beds and rivers.</p>
<p>But these companies ended up not dredging the sand themselves. They made a profit by selling the rights to other companies.</p>
<p><i>Tuoi Tre</i> reported that in one case last year dozens of local lobster fishermen took matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>Described as fed up with official inaction, the fishermen attacked sand miners whom they blamed for destroying their livelihoods.</p>
<p>After the <i>Tuoi Tre</i> series appeared, Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh admitted that some local officials had covered up for the damage done by sand dredging.</p>
<p>Much of the work was being done at night by hundreds of dredging ships, according to a government report.</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister ordered penalties for local officials who failed to manage the problem, asked for more intense inspections of the mining, and said that a police campaign would be launched to support the effort from March 15 to June 1, 2017.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t appear that this effort has been totally effective.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to make sand artificially.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s Institute of Science and Technology presented a report to the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transport saying that artificial sand could be made for up to 15 percent more cheaply than that produced by sand dredging.</p>
<p>VnExpress, a popular website, said on March 19 this year that Vietnam is exploring the possibility of producing artificial sand from sedentary rock, which is abundant in the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>Artificial sand has been used in many parts of the world in construction projects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a major report on sand dredging in Vietnam published on March 18 this year by <i>National Geographic </i>magazine states that sand has become “an astonishingly hot commodity.”</p>
<p>“Sand is the key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam’s fast-growing cities,” the report says, “and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam’s rivers, but also on the all-important Mekong Delta.”</p>
<p>For centuries, the Delta, which is the home to nearly 18 million people, has been replenished by sediment carried down from the waters flowing down the Mekong River from the glaciers of Tibet.</p>
<p>But in recent years the sediment flow has been severely reduced by Chinese dams on the Mekong upstream from Vietnam and Cambodia as well as by sand dredging and climate change.</p>
<p><b>Cambodia’s lost sand </b></p>
<p>Radio Free Asia has reported nearly a dozen times on the environmental damage caused by sand dredging in Cambodia since 2010 and as recently as February of this year.</p>
<p>And the British non-governmental organization Global Witness warned nine years ago that Cambodia’s elite were violating the country’s own laws by profiting behind the scenes from its extractive industries, including sand dredging.</p>
<p>In May 2010, Global Witness published a report titled “Shifting Sands,” which accused Prime Minister Hun Sen’s family and friends of essentially selling off Cambodia’s sand.</p>
<p>A Global Witness team examined a sand-mining permit that was stamped by an official in Singapore’s embassy in Thailand. This indicated some level of Singaporean complicity in Cambodia’s corrupt sand trade deals.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Global Witness is currently banned from working in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Monitoring sand dredging in Cambodia can be a risky business.</p>
<p>Two activists of the NGO Mother Nature Cambodia (MNC) were jailed in September of 2017 for filming two sand-carrying vessels off the coast of an economic land concession in southern Cambodia’s Koh Kong Province.</p>
<p>According to the NGO’s founder Alex Gonzalez Davidson, the two activists were found guilty in “a circus-like trial” and subsequently released on suspended sentences in mid-February.</p>
<p>“One of the two is continuing with his activism even more resolutely than before his illegal jailing,” said Gonzalez Davidson.</p>
<p>Gonzalez Davison had been deported from Cambodia on the orders of Hun Sen.</p>
<p>But despite his deportation and the jailing of a total of five of the NGO’s members, he says, “we didn’t disband or shut down. On the contrary, we grew bigger, and new activists joined us.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez Davidson says that his group’s monitoring campaign had some success in halting the exports of sand to Singapore, which from 2008 to 2016 reached millions of tons of sand used for land reclamation.</p>
<p>In November, 2016 sand exports to Singapore appeared to halt altogether, according to MNC research.</p>
<p>In July 2017, following numerous local protests against the sand dredging, the Cambodian government had banned exports of two kinds of sand being extracted from the Cambodian coastal province of Koh Kong.</p>
<p>However, exports of silica sand, the kind of sand that the two MNC members were monitoring, continues, with an estimated 20 to 40,000 tons of that sand being exported to Taiwan each month and other smaller quantities possibly going to China.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Thailand’s national electricity authority has decided to delay a decision to purchase power to be produced by a controversial Mekong River hydropower dam.</p>
<p>The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) said in mid-February that it has delayed a decision to purchase power produced by the Pak Beng Dam in Laos until an ongoing review of the country’s power development plan can be completed.</p>
<p>While that may sound like a technicality, it’s being interpreted by analysts as a sign that, along with other issues involved, the Thai government has been listening to concerns about the dam expressed by local Thai communities and by civil society groups.</p>
<p>These communities and organizations have for several years been outspoken in pointing to the potential negative environmental impacts resulting from construction of the Pak Beng dam, including on Thailand.</p>
<p>Thailand’s review of its national power development plan is expected to be complete at the end of this month. It could now determine whether the dam will be built or not.</p>
<p>According to experts, the dam could severely affect downstream fishermen and farmers by disrupting fish migration patterns and blocking vital sediment flows needed to refresh farmland, plants, and the smaller organisms on which the fish feed.</p>
<p>Other dams in China, Laos, and Cambodia block adult fish trying to migrate upstream and larvae and juveniles trying to migrate downstream.</p>
<p>Some dams in Laos and Cambodia use fish ladders intended to mitigate the harm to fish, but at this stage these amount to experiments that have yet to be proven effective.</p>
<p>A fish ladder, or fish pass, is a structure built around dams to facilitate natural migration.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, but it involves carefully matching the fishes’ swimming patterns with the water flows.</p>
<p>And fish ladders around the world have had a mixed record of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Experts concluded seven years ago that a fish pass on Laos’s Mun River, an important tributary of the Mekong, had been a total failure, with fewer than a quarter of the river’s fish species making it through the passage.</p>
<p>The stakes involved in all of this are huge, not only at the high end among banks, bureaucrats, and developers, but also among ordinary people.</p>
<p>Fish are the main source of protein for millions of people living along the Mekong River downstream from the proposed Pak Beng dam.</p>
<p>When completed, the dam is expected to be the third large-scale hydropower project to be built in Laos on the Mekong mainstream, after the Xayaburi and Don Sahong dams. And it’s expected to cost some $2.4 billion to build and five years to complete.</p>
<p>The lead project developer is China’s Datong Corporation, working together with a subsidiary of EGAT and Électricité du Laos (EDL).</p>
<p>International Rivers, an environmental watchdog, estimates that 6,700 people will have to be relocated to build the Pak Beng dam, with 25 villages in Laos already directly affected by work being done in preparation for its construction.</p>
<p>On a larger sale, the impacts of the dam on the flow of the Mekong could affect the livelihoods of millions of people living downstream from the project.</p>
<p><b>What the dam’s suspension might mean</b></p>
<p>As International Rivers has noted, 90 percent of the electricity generated by the Pak Beng dam is proposed for sale to Thailand.</p>
<p>But does Thailand really need this much electricity?</p>
<p>Experts in both the Thai government and nongovernmental sector have argued that, given its high energy reserves, the country has no need for more electricity from a dam built abroad in Laos, according to Brian Eyler, an expert based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Eyler directs the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan research center.</p>
<p>Analysts such as Eyler have long questioned what they describe as Thailand’s inflated energy demand projections.</p>
<p>In their view, the loss of the Pak Beng dam’s power output is unlikely to affect Thailand’s energy consumption in any significant way.</p>
<p>“This development appears to be a bellwether for how plans for future dam projects, especially for Mekong mainstream dams, might falter,” Eyler says.</p>
<p>Thailand’s suspension of the power purchase for the dam, he says, “can create a pathway to a more sustainable water-energy blueprint for the region—one that better optimizes food, water, and energy outcomes…and could conserve the Mekong river’s core environmental flows.”</p>
<p>It might also signal that the time has come for several nations in the region—Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, in particular—to take advantage of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.</p>
<p>All three countries offer ideal conditions for solar and wind power generation.</p>
<p>And prices for the equipment needed for these renewable energy sources have plummeted in the past few years.</p>
<p>Maureen Harris, the Southeast Asia program director for International Rivers, says that it’s too early to say what the current delay in the Pak Beng dam project will mean for the project overall.</p>
<p>But, she says, the delay indicates that campaigning by Mekong communities and environmentalists to raise concerns over the project, and particularly in Thailand, has had an impact.</p>
<p><b><img alt="pakbeng-map-03162018.jpg" class="image-inline" src="https://tengview.rfaweb.org/english/commentaries/laos-dam-03162018154503.html/pakbeng-map-03162018.jpg" title="pakbeng-map-03162018.jpg"/>Strong resistance to dams in Thailand</b></p>
<p>Analysts like Eyler find it interesting that the EGAT issued its announcement of a delay in the Pak Beng dam project to Rak Chiang Kong, a grassroots nongovernmental group in Thailand that has been advocating for protection of the Mekong River and its resources.</p>
<p>The group has also been promoting community-focused sustainability practices in Thailand’s Chiang Rai province.</p>
<p>In a letter, Rak Chiang Kong had asked EGAT about the status of the Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA).</p>
<p>Rak Chiang Kong had held a dialogue on the Pak Beng dam, bringing Thai stakeholders, the Lao government, and Chinese dam developers together in January this year.</p>
<p>Harris says that the Thai government’s cabinet members have to approve a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) before EGAT can go ahead with it.</p>
<p>Harris adds that Thai government officials are likely to be well aware of Rak Chiang Khong’s concerns regarding the Pak Beng dam project because of a lawsuit filed by the group that is now before Thailand’s Administrative Court.</p>
<p>Finally, Harris says, “there’s a growing amount of information and analysis publicly available on alternatives for Mekong countries to meet energy needs in more sustainable and equitable ways.”</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Analysts tend to agree that the recent visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam has sent a powerful signal to China that the United States is in the South China Sea to stay.</p>
<p>But aside from the five-day port call’s symbolic significance, several expert analysts caution that Vietnam’s next steps in strengthening defense ties with the U.S. are likely to be both cautious and carefully calibrated.</p>
<p>“The visit always was viewed by both sides as largely symbolic, so at that level it can be viewed as a success,” said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington D.C.-based think tank.</p>
<p>Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, says regarding the carrier’s visit, “I’d caution against getting too far ahead of ourselves in over-reading the ramifications.”</p>
<p>“The follow-on steps will likely remain calibrated and incremental,” says Dr. Koh. “No quantum leaps.”</p>
<p>According to Hiebert, Vietnam will want to move cautiously not only in order to avoid antagonizing China but also because of how improving relations will be received by conservatives in Vietnam’s military, who continue to suffer from an “America syndrome,” a legacy of the Vietnam  War.</p>
<p><b>Communist Party control</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, it’s important to remember that Vietnam is still ruled by a communist party.</p>
<p>David Brown, a former U.S. diplomat and now a journalist who frequently visits Vietnam, notes that Vietnam’s Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong made his career as a Party theorist.</p>
<p>Trong outmaneuvered former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in a power contest at a Party Congress in January 2016 and is now regarded as Vietnam’s leading political figure.</p>
<p>Bill Hayton, an author who has written extensively on China, Vietnam, and the South China Sea for the BBC, says that Trong regarded Nguyen Tan Dung’s most powerful comrades as too individualistic, too corrupt, and too pro-American.</p>
<p>Some of those allies have been given jail sentences or have been ousted from their positions.</p>
<p>And as Hayton notes, Vietnam has a policy of “three nos” when it comes to its foreign relations: no foreign bases on its territory, no military alliances, and no involving third parties in its disputes.</p>
<p>Vietnam isn’t about to sign off on a U.S.-led containment of China, says Hayton.</p>
<p>On the other hand, says David Brown, “if the U.S. chooses to contest China’s bid for hegemony over the South China Sea and its littoral, Vietnam is the essential local partner.”</p>
<p>No other Southeast Asian nation has been willing speak out or to stand up to Chinese incursions in the South China Sea to the degree that Vietnam or Vietnamese citizens have.</p>
<p>On May 14, 2014, when China moved an oil-drilling rig near Vietnam's central coast, it triggered anti-Chinese rioting.</p>
<p>More than 20 people, many of them from China and Taiwan, were killed, according to news agency reports at the time. Hundreds of Chinese fled from Vietnam into neighboring Cambodia.</p>
<p>In the end, China withdrew the rig.</p>
<p>Anti-Chinese feelings can still be detected today throughout Vietnam, based partly on a centuries-long history of Vietnamese struggles against Chinese domination.</p>
<p>China’s invasion of northern Vietnam in 1979 added to harsh feelings toward China. Military experts tend to agree that Vietnamese troops performed better than the Chinese in the resulting border war.</p>
<p>But the Chinese triggered anger when their departing troops damaged civilian homes, a railroad, and a hospital on their way out of the country. Some of the Chinese troops also looted Vietnamese homes.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese driver once told this commentator that he hated the Chinese.</p>
<p>I asked him why. He responded with one word: “History.”</p>
<p>Brown says, however, that the current leadership under Nguyen Phu Trong has made “a sustained effort to improve relations with China, building on ideological affinity.”</p>
<p>This detente follows periods of tension between the two sides centered on a number of South China Sea islands claimed by both China and Vietnam as well as by several other nations.</p>
<p><b>The human side</b></p>
<p>In the end, the contacts between American sailors and the Vietnamese whom they met in Da Nang may leave a stronger impression on some Vietnamese than that left by the aircraft carrier itself.</p>
<p>During the ship’s port call from March 5 to 9, some of the sailors visited an orphanage and a center for the treatment of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant sprayed widely on forests by the U.S. military that ended up poisoning many rural Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Other sailors played soccer and basketball with their Vietnamese counterparts.</p>
<p>In a much-commented-on performance, a U.S. Navy singer backed by a Navy band sang a song devoted to unity and reconciliation by Trinh Cong Son, one of Vietnam’s most popular singer-songwriters during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Son, who was sometimes described as the “Bob Dylan of Vietnam”, because of his anti-war songs, had some of his works banned by North and South Vietnam during the war.</p>
<p>When a Navy singer launched into Son’s unity song in perfect Vietnamese, a Vietnamese crowd began clapping, swaying, and sometimes singing along with her.</p>
<p>This moment may be remembered much longer by some Vietnamese than the carrier visit itself.</p>
<p>Some experts had expected that the Vietnamese government would restrain Vietnamese press coverage of the carrier’s port call in order not to offend China. But that appears not to have happened.</p>
<p>Tuoi Tre, a popular Vietnamese newspaper and online site, ran at least five stories during the visit. And VietnamNet, another popular site, published three stories.</p>
<p><b>What comes next</b></p>
<p>In 2016, President Barack Obama lifted all legal constraints on U.S. arms sales to Vietnam.</p>
<p>But this has not come to much so far.</p>
<p>Hiebert of CSIS says that the U.S. has tried to get Vietnam to expand joint naval exercises with Vietnam but that Hanoi has consistently declined in order to avoid antagonizing China.</p>
<p>More joint naval exercises and joint training are now possible, though, he says.</p>
<p>Beyond the delicacy of handling Chinese sensibilities, deeper U.S.-Vietnam military engagement and arms sales would face a potential hurdle in the fact that Hanoi’s military remains primarily trained and equipped along Russian lines in a relationship dating back to when the former Soviet Union backed the communist North in the Vietnam War.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Animal rights activists have been winning battles to save endangered bears in several Asian countries, but much still needs to be done.</p>
<p>Bile extracted from bears has been prized as a traditional medicine in East Asian countries for hundreds of years. It has also served as an additive in Asian wines and tonics. And it’s claimed by some to counter impotence.</p>
<p>The demand for bear bile comes largely from China, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam. A few bear cubs have been known to have been captured in Myanmar and shipped by traffickers to China, where they are much in demand.</p>
<p>The bears, which are mostly Asiatic black bears, are often called moon bears because of the white fur crescents on their chests.</p>
<p>Many bears are kept in captivity, often on bear farms, to facilitate the extraction of their bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The extraction by catheters can cause permanent damage and lead to infections.</p>
<p>Farmed bears are frequently kept in small cages, sometimes small enough to prevent the bears from turning around or standing upright.</p>
<p>Some who are caught as cubs may live under such conditions during a lifetime lasting 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>When the bears outlive their most productive years at around 10 years old, some are then killed for body parts considered delicacies, including their paws.</p>
<p>But no one knows with certainty how many of the Asiatic black bears are in captivity or how many are still roaming free in forests.</p>
<p>According to Traffic East Asia, a monitoring organization, there are 25,000 moon bears left in the world.</p>
<p>But the Bear Conservation Action Plan published by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the numbers of moon bears in China as fewer than 20,000.</p>
<p>The World Wildlife Foundation says the figure may be as low as 16,000.</p>
<p>Experts agree that China is home to the largest number of moon bears, most of which can be found in forested areas of northern and southern China.</p>
<p><b>China’s endangered bears</b></p>
<p>The last official figures for captive bears in China from late 2007 came to 7,002 bears on 68 farms.</p>
<p>But the Animals Asia Foundation (AAF), a charity based in Hong Kong, believes that the figure could now be as high 10,000.</p>
<p>Bear farms are supposed to be licensed by the government, but experts suspect there are some smaller, illegal unlicensed farms that go uncounted.</p>
<p>Unlike the American black bear, which is showing an increase in its population in some places, the Asiatic black bear is an endangered species in China. This is partly due to deforestation in northern and southern China,  where the bears are most heavily concentrated.</p>
<p>According to Animals Asia, China has introduced some legal improvements.</p>
<p>In 1989, under a wild animal protection law, the Chinese government made it illegal to hunt bears for their parts, such as gall bladders, paws, and claws.</p>
<p>However, Animals Asia said that more than 20 percent of bears coming from bear farms to its rescue center were missing limbs, indicating that bears were still being targeted in the wild in violation of existing laws.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what is described as a “new method” of extracting bile from bears in China that was introduced several years ago has proved to be as cruel and as damaging as any of the old methods.</p>
<p>On the positive side, Animals Asia is working with its Chinese government partners to close more bear farms and rescue caged and tortured moon bears.</p>
<p>A number of traditional Chinese medicine doctors working with Animals Asia have condemned the prescription and consumption of bear bile.</p>
<p>For the fortunate bears which are able to escape a life of torture and confinement, Animals Asia runs two bear sanctuaries in Asia, one in Chengdu, China, and another in Vietnam, located in a national park in the northern part of the country.</p>
<p><b>Making progress in Vietnam</b></p>
<p>In 2013, Animals Asia, which has been working with government officials and local environmentalists in Vietnam, survived a threatened revocation of its lease on its bear sanctuary, located about 30 miles north of Hanoi.</p>
<p>We know the details of how Vietnam’s then Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung intervened in 2013 to halt a plan to close the bear rescue center thanks to reporting for the web-based <i>Asia Sentinel</i> by David Brown, a former U.S. diplomat now working as a journalist.</p>
<p>According to Brown, Animals Asia mobilized tens of thousands of petitions to the prime minister, mobilized celebrities and a dozen ambassadors, and attracted thousands of backers on Facebook.</p>
<p>In the end, a plan to allow construction of a commercial ecotourism project to replace the bear sanctuary was defeated in a country where, Brown says, development projects promoted by top government officials all too often  “simply steamroll the opposition.”</p>
<p>On July 19, 2017 Animals Asia signed a memorandum with the Vietnamese government aimed at ensuring a complete end to bear bile farming by 2020.</p>
<p>This followed an earlier agreement to rescue the remaining bears still caged on farms across Vietnam, believed to number about 1,000.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese traditional medicine Association had earlier agreed to ensure an end to bear bile prescriptions by 2020.</p>
<p><b>South Korea’s success story</b></p>
<p>South Korea was a latecomer to the bear bile business and had to import bears in the early 1980s to meet a growing demand, which was driven partly by a belief that bear bile could cure ailments such as liver disease.</p>
<p>According to Russel McLendon, writing for the Mother Nature Network (mnn) website, after hunters killed many wild moon bears in the last century, scientists in North Korea found a way to extract bile from live ones.</p>
<p>“This was supposed to take the heat off the bears, and it quickly caught on in China—which had thousands of captive bears by the 1990s—as well as South Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries,’’ McLendon says.</p>
<p>“Due to deforestation and poaching, however, the … decline didn’t stop, and annual demand for bile in China actually grew,” he says.</p>
<p>But the bile business went into a sharp decline in South Korea some years ago. Many Koreans have opposed the suffering that captive bears endure, and the bears there are now protected by law.</p>
<p>Many Koreans are also said to admire bears for their courage and determination.</p>
<p>As McLendon notes, the official mascot for the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games to be held March 8-18 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is a moon bear.</p>
<p>Some of the credit for South Korea’s success in countering the cruel treatment of captive bears should go to the nongovernmental organizations World Animal Protection and Green Korea United, the latter of which has worked with the South Korean bear bile industry since 2003.</p>
<p>In 2014, Green Korea United facilitated an agreement between the South Korean government and the bear bile industry aimed at improving the protection of the bears.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China has expanded its presence in the Indian Ocean, causing India to respond with a military build-up and far-reaching diplomatic contacts with potential allies.</p>
<p>During and after the time that Indian troops ended a more than two-month-long Himalayan standoff with Chinese soldiers in the remote kingdom of Bhutan’s Doklam Plateau last August, nationalistic feelings have been running high in India.</p>
<p>In what some Indians refer to as “Post-Doklam Development,” India has been ramping up infrastructure projects along its long and poorly demarcated border with China.</p>
<p>New Delhi has also speeded up the acquisition of new weapons and their deployment, according to Debasis Dash, a researcher specializing in strategic affairs who is currently studying at the University of Malaya.</p>
<p>According to the Times of India, the Indian government plans to recruit 15 new battalions of troops to bolster border defenses along its borders with China and Pakistan. This would come to about 15,000 men.</p>
<p>Three nuclear powers—China, India, and India’s long-time nemesis, Pakistan—are engaged in this strategic power game.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, India has been deepening ties with Southeast Asian nations, many of which have been looking to India to counterbalance China’s growing power and influence.</p>
<p>In order to protect sea lanes, India has bolstered its ties with Australia and Japan while looking to them for assistance. As the <i>Financial Times</i> noted recently, the idea of an “Indo-Pacific” region with India playing a more active strategic role has been endorsed by Australia, Japan, and U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>But India now faces a crisis in the Maldives islands, located near the southwestern tip of the Indian subcontinent, that should test how forcefully India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is prepared to respond to growing Chinese influence.</p>
<p>The former president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, has appealed to India to intervene in the Maldives to deal with the ongoing political crisis there.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that Prime Minister Modi was distressed at the ouster of Nasheed in a coup in 2012. After being jailed, Nasheed was allowed to go into exile for medical treatment and now lives in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><b>Modi and the Maldives.</b></p>
<p>India’s sensitivity to Chinese moves in its backyard became apparent early last month when the parliament of the Maldives, the smallest and least populous nation in South Asia, endorsed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-based Indian Express said that the Maldives’ parliament “rushed through” the FTA despite much internal criticism of it.</p>
<p>It was the Maldives’ first such agreement with any country.</p>
<p>On Feb. 5, facing popular unrest, Maldives President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency. Yameen then sent troops into the streets of Male, the nation’s capital, to maintain control.</p>
<p>Yameen had directed the arrest of two Supreme Court justices shortly after the high court issued a ruling calling for the release of jailed opposition politicians in the Maldives.</p>
<p>The Maldives, an island chain with a population of roughly 400,000 people, is best known for its luxury resorts and coral reefs. But because of its location just southwest of the southern tip of India near vital international shipping lanes, India considers it strategically important.</p>
<p><b>International pressure</b></p>
<p>According to <i>The New York Times</i>, Nasheed had become an international celebrity because of his work to combat climate change. He also happened to be the country’s first and only democratically elected leader. So his words carry weight both in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>On Feb. 2, Nasheed had said that he planned to run again for office. But President Yameen, now ruling under what amounts to martial law, was already making plans to run for reelection later this year. With all of his opponents jailed or in exile, he would be running unopposed.</p>
<p>Nasheed urged India to send an envoy to the Maldives backed by the military,” according to a report from New Delhi by Amy Kazin of <i>The Financial Times </i>over the past weekend (Feb. 10-11).</p>
<p>But it’s not at all clear at this point whether Prime Minister Modi would consider intervening in the Maldives.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Modi on Feb. 8 to discuss various topics, including the situation in the Maldives. The two “expressed concern about the political crisis in the Maldives and the importance of respect for democratic institutions and the rule of law,” according to a statement issued by the White House.</p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, meanwhile, described the moves made by Maldives President Yameen as an “all-out assault on democracy.”</p>
<p>China, on the other hand, has come out strongly in defense of the Maldives leader.</p>
<p>China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told an envoy from the Maldives on Feb. 8 that China believes the Maldives government and people have “the wisdom and ability to appropriately handle the issue facing them and return the country to normal order in accordance with the law.”</p>
<p>China has invested heavily in the Maldives. As <i>The Economist</i> magazine explains in its current issue (Feb. 10-16),  China has backed several Chinese projects in the Maldives with loans.</p>
<p>The projects include a hospital, a U.S. $800 million expansion of the airport, and a China Maldives Friendship Bridge between the capital and the airport.</p>
<p>According to <i>The Economist</i>, “There is no public tendering, and no budgets have been published.”</p>
<p>“Diplomats and NGOs suspect costs have been wildly inflated,” the magazine’s “Banyan” columnist says. “Any default, and China can extract concessions, such as a base on the Indian Ocean.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everyone assumes that Chinese cash is “lining politicians’ pockets” in the Maldives.</p>
<p>Former President Nasheed has alleged that nearly a quarter of the Maldives’ budget goes to interest payments. Others on the island itself estimate that three-fifths of the debts that the country is amassing are owed to China. Nasheed calls it a “debt trap” that gives China huge leverage over the Maldives.</p>
<p><b>Worsened relations</b></p>
<p>Indian relations with the Maldives have deteriorated since 2012, when the Maldives expropriated its international airport from an Indian company which had a contract to upgrade and operate the airport.</p>
<p>China in recent years has forged closer ties with India’s neighbors, including Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. <i>The Financial Times </i>reported that in 2015, the Maldives amended its constitution, allowing foreigners to buy land, thus paving the way for Chinese companies to buy islands, which India says have potential military use.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said that two Chinese military ships docked at a Maldivian port last August. Other reports say that it was three ships.</p>
<p>India has long considered the Maldives to be part of its sphere of influence, given its proximity to India as well as the historical ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>In 1988, India intervened in the Maldives with a military force to prevent an attempted coup backed by an armed Sri Lankan separatist group known as the Tamil Tigers.</p>
<p>Now Indian foreign policy hawks and some foreign policy analysts see China’s growing presence in the Maldives as a test of India’s claim to be a rising power capable of maintaining regional security.</p>
<p>In one much-quoted comment, a Rumel Dahiya, a retired Indian Army brigadier general, said that “if India cannot even safeguard its primary interests so close to its mainland, then it can hardly be trusted to become a net security provider for the wider region.”</p>
<p>Dahiya’s comment was published by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi.</p>
<p>According to Stratfor, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank and consultancy, if India intervenes in the Maldives, it could “tilt the regional political scales in favor of China,” which has already benefited from anti-Indian sentiment in Nepal.</p>
<p>Sending Indian troops into the Maldives, Stratfor says, “would undoubtedly reinforce New Delhi’s image as a domineering hegemon unafraid to use force against its smaller neighbors.”</p>
<p>For decades, the Maldives was considered a model Islamic nation, says Stratfor. Its Muslim majority practiced a tolerant form of Islam. But in recent years its Muslims have leaned toward Salafist and Wahabi forms of Islam. Some of this has come from students who studied these ultra-conservative ideologies in Pakistan and in Saudi Arabia, a supporter of the current government in the Maldives.</p>
<p><b>The Pakistani factor</b></p>
<p>Even as it copes with China, India continues to consider neighboring Pakistan to be a major security threat. India has fought five wars with Pakistan since 1947. Skirmishes between the two sides in divided Kashmir have become routine over the decades.</p>
<p>So it’s obvious that India would be concerned about reports that China is planning to build a naval base close to the Pakistani port of Gwadar.</p>
<p>Gwadar is located on the Arabian Sea only 690 nautical miles west of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Both China and Pakistan deny reports of a plan to build a Chinese naval base at Gwadar. But The Economist notes that construction at the port is planned as part of a $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is intended to connect landlocked western China to the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>The United States, meanwhile, announced on Jan. 4 that it would suspend most U.S. security assistance to Pakistan, pending a stronger effort by Pakistan to expel the Taliban and enemies of Afghanistan’s government from the Pakistani side of the two countries’ border.</p>
<p>Such a development would have been unthinkable during the Cold War years when Pakistan was considered a staunch military ally of the United States.</p>
<p>The suspension of security aid would cost Pakistan an estimated U.S. $2 billion in aid already budgeted.</p>
<p>But China, describing Pakistan as its “irreplaceable all-weather friend,” seems more than ready to make up for any shortfall in security funding for the South Asian country.</p>
<p>Analysts explain that for Pakistan, Gwadar has the potential to act as a counter to any Indian attempt to blockade the port of Karachi, the most populous city in Pakistan. Karachi’s port handles more than 60 percent of the country’s cargo.</p>
<p>Joel Wuthnow, a research fellow at the U.S. National Defense University, says that “Indian strategists worry that Chinese investments in the Indian Ocean region, such as port development projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, will precipitate a greater Chinese naval presence in India’s backyard.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wuthnow spoke at a hearing on China’s Belt and Road Initiative held by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on Jan. 25.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Deep mutual mistrust appears to be the only constant factor in Indian-Pakistani relations. But mutual nuclear deterrence seems to be working.<br/><br/><i><b>Dan Southerland is RFA's founding executive editor.</b></i></p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>It was 50 years ago, but I still vividly recall the attack on Saigon.</p>
<p>Like many others, I woke up in the South Vietnamese capital on Jan. 30, 1968 thinking that I heard firecrackers exploding to celebrate Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>But as I walked near the Saigon River waterfront, I realized that what I heard was automatic weapons fire, not firecrackers. In the predawn hours, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops had launched the Tet Offensive throughout South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Communist and South Vietnamese sides had separately announced that they would respect a two-day cease-fire for the Tet celebration. But the Communists had broken the truce.</p>
<p>I’d had nearly two years’ experience reporting for United Press International (UPI) in Vietnam. But I’d never heard shooting like this before in the South Vietnamese capital.</p>
<p>Saigon had suffered in the past from terrorist incidents, such as grenade attacks. And in June 1965, a Viet Cong fighter had detonated two bombs that destroyed a floating restaurant located only a few blocks from the UPI office. As many as 48 people died.</p>
<p>But suddenly, in the early hours of late January 1968, the Vietnamese city which I’d always considered to be a relatively safe haven had now become a combat zone.</p>
<p>At the UPI office, I found the bureau chief taking calls from field reporters and trying to reach American officials to confirm details of a Viet Cong attack on the U.S Embassy in Saigon.</p>
<p>Not far from the office, the Viet Cong had attacked South Vietnamese Navy headquarters. Two American soldiers whose truck convoy was ambushed near that location had met in the street with a UPI reporter, then carefully made their way with him into the office and thrown themselves on the newsroom floor.</p>
<p>One of them shouted that the reporters and bureau chief who were taking dictation and typing up stories while shooting was going on nearby were “crazy” not to be taking cover.</p>
<p>American and South Vietnamese forces defeated the attackers in Saigon within a few days, but elsewhere throughout South Vietnam fighting continued in many locations. It took the Americans and South Vietnamese nearly three weeks to regain control of the old imperial city of Hue.</p>
<p>But in most of the country, the South Vietnamese forces fought better than many of their American advisors had expected, with the Communist side suffering high casualties. Some estimates of the number of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese killed came to 30,000 or many more.</p>
<p>In numerous cases, however, the allies used artillery and air strikes to dislodge the Communists, causing a large number of civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>Civilian casualties </b></p>
<p>About five weeks after the attack on Saigon, I traveled south from Saigon into the Mekong Delta to report on the damage done during Viet Cong attacks on most of the cities in South Vietnam’s major rice-growing region.</p>
<p>Together with other reporters in the city of Ben Tre, I interviewed civilians who had been caught in the middle of gun battles when American infantrymen entered the city to retake it from the Viet Cong under the cover of air strikes and artillery fire.</p>
<p>The Viet Cong outnumbered the South Vietnamese Army’s force in Ben Tre six to one, because roughly half of the South Vietnamese there had left their posts to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.</p>
<p>Authorities said that some 1,000 civilians were killed in the city, which was more than American, South Vietnamese, and Viet Cong casualties combined.</p>
<p>I later visited an ethnic Cambodian hamlet in the Mekong Delta that had been largely destroyed by U.S. Army helicopters after the Viet Cong invaded it. The Viet Cong were driven out, but the people had fled and were afraid to return without being guaranteed protection.</p>
<p>The number of refugees in South Vietnam already registered with the government in 1967 numbered 2.1 million. Refugees fleeing battles during the Tet Offensive numbered at least one million.</p>
<p><b>A Communist defeat</b></p>
<p>According to military historian James H. Willbanks, the Communists had three goals in mind when they launched their nationwide offensive at the end of January, 1968:</p>
<p>1)    To provoke a “general uprising” among the South Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>2)    To shatter the South Vietnamese armed forces.</p>
<p>3)    To convince the Americans that the war could not be won.</p>
<p>It was clear early on that the Communists had failed to achieve the first two goals.</p>
<p>No uprising occurred in any location that I’m aware of. South Vietnamese citizens didn’t rush out to welcome the Viet Cong.</p>
<p>In numerous battles, the South Vietnamese Army took heavy losses but fought bravely against the Communists and regained territory that had been lost.</p>
<p>Communist casualties were much higher in the end than those suffered by the Americans or South Vietnamese.</p>
<p>After the war, the North Vietnamese leadership admitted that they had “set their goals too high” and made several mistakes in launching the Tet Offensive. They overestimated support for the Communists in the South, while “grossly underestimating the strength and resilience” of the South Vietnamese Army.</p>
<p><b>A psychological victory</b></p>
<p>But in the end the Tet Offensive proved to be a psychological victory and a turning point in the war.</p>
<p>As Willbanks explained in an article published recently in “Vietnam” magazine, the offensive achieved psychological successes, particularly in the early phases.</p>
<p>Television images of 19 or 20 Viet Cong guerrillas inside the U.S. Embassy grounds shocked people in the United States, although U.S. Marine guards killed most of the guerrillas and captured three.</p>
<p>It was later learned that the Communists had planned for a much larger Viet Cong force to arrive once sappers had cut through the compound walls, but that second group failed to make it to Saigon on time. As a result, none of the guerrillas made it into the embassy chancellery, the main building housing embassy offices.</p>
<p>Based on erroneous reports from military policemen outside the embassy, news agencies initially reported that the guerrillas had penetrated the embassy. They had to correct the initial reports. But the early images of dead guerrillas inside the compound stayed with some American television viewers.</p>
<p>According to Willbanks, the fighting that raged in Hue, Khe Sanh, and throughout South Vietnam “shook the confidence of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, causing many Americans to question the advisability of continuing the war.”</p>
<p><b>Myths about the Tet Offensive</b></p>
<p>According to some accounts written over the years, U.S. media reporting on the Tet Offensive was largely responsible for undermining American support for the Vietnam War. But a new book by historian Edwin E. Moise of Clemson University, makes a strong case that this is incorrect.</p>
<p>Moise’s book is titled <i>The Myths of Tet: The Most Misunderstood Event of the Vietnam War</i>.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that one newsman did have a major impact: When Walter Cronkite of CBS concluded that the war had reached “a stalemate” this did affect President Johnson’s views.</p>
<p>But most important, in my view, in undercutting American support for the war were statements in the months preceding the Tet attacks from General William Westmoreland, commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Prior to the Tet Offensive, Westmoreland had on several occasions asserted that the U.S. had succeeded in destroying many Communist units and was winning the war.</p>
<p>It came as a shock then to many in the U.S. when the Communists showed that they possessed the capability of attacking 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five major cities, 64 district capitals, and numerous villages and hamlets.</p>
<p>The photo taken by Eddie Adams of the Associated Press of South Vietnam’s National Police Chief Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a handcuffed Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon on Feb. 1 also had a huge impact in the U.S.</p>
<p>But as Adams later explained, “pictures don’t tell the whole story.”</p>
<p>The prisoner had just killed the wife, mother, and six children of a Vietnamese officer on the outskirts of Saigon.</p>
<p><b>Did anyone see this coming?</b></p>
<p>It’s often said that the Tet Offensive came as a complete surprise, and it certainly struck me at the time that it was.</p>
<p>But we now know that U.S. Intelligence officers had intercepted numerous Communist radio communications in the months leading up to Jan. 30, 1968 indicating that “something big” was being prepared by the Communist side. No one really seemed to know, however, just how big it would be.</p>
<p>But Lt. Gen. Fred Weyand, commander of the American forces in III Corps, the region surrounding Saigon, took the threat seriously, according Moise’s new book.</p>
<p>Weyand, Moise says, moved “significant American forces” away from areas near the Cambodian border area prior to the Communist attack on Saigon and closer to the Vietnamese capital.</p>
<p>Another persisting myth has it that Vo Nguyen Giap, the schoolmaster turned defense minister who masterminded the Communist attack in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu which drove the French out of Vietnam, must have been the key planner behind the Tet Offensive.</p>
<p>Thanks to new research done by American scholars, we now know that Giap was opposed to launching the Tet Offensive and was isolated from decision-making on the issue in 1967. Communist Party First Secretary Le Duan led a purge of officials close to Giap and patriarch Ho Chi Minh, who also opposed launching the offensive.</p>
<p>Moise says that another myth about Tet holds that the Communists had organized highly coordinated attacks. In many ways, he says, the attacks were badly coordinated. Confusing communications from Hanoi as to the start date caused some units in central Vietnam to attack a day prior to Jan. 30.</p>
<p>I recently found one of my old notebooks from early May of 1968.  It contains descriptions of Viet Cong units getting lost on the outskirts and in the streets of Saigon.</p>

</div>Lasting personal memories </b></p>
<p>On a personal level, I’ll never forget several colleagues who were killed during a second wave of attacks on Saigon in early May of 1968.</p>
<p>Charlie Eggleston, a UPI photographer, was killed by a Viet Cong sniper on May 6, 1968. I remember Charlie as a likeable guy who was always out in front of the rest of us. In this case, he was carrying a rifle when he was hit.</p>
<p>The Viet Cong killing of four Western journalists in the Cholon district of Saigon a day earlier, on May 5, had a profound impact on me. Four Australian journalists and a British colleague were unarmed and riding in a mini-moke when Vietnamese civilians warned them that a Viet Cong unit was up ahead.</p>
<p>After it was too late for them to turn back, the Viet Cong opened fire on the mini-moke. A Viet Cong officer then drew his pistol and pumped bullets into two of the wounded men despite shouts from Australian journalist Michael Birch that they were “bao chi, bao chi”-- meaning press, press!</p>
<p>Frank Palmos, a freelance journalist from Australia and the one man who survived the killing, said that the Viet Cong commander had “seemed to enjoy his work” of firing bullets into wounded men.</p>
<p>Palmos fled into a crowd of Vietnamese who tried to protect him as the Viet Cong officer fired wildly in his direction.</p>
<p>In 1988, Vietnam’s Communist government issued a statement of “profound regret” for the killings, saying that it was “clearly a case of mistaken identity,” which it clearly was not.</p>
<p>The journalists were unarmed. Their mini-moke carried no military markings. They had no military escort.</p>
<p>After that attack, I started carrying a pistol in my pocket, which was one of the stupidest things that I did during the Vietnam War. I never learned how to use that pistol, a revolver. But if I were captured, I might have been regarded as a combatant and immediately shot.</p>
<p><b>Rocket attacks on Saigon </b></p>
<p>One of my jobs for UPI from late 1966 into 1968 was to follow up on Viet Cong-instigated explosions in the streets as well as on Viet Cong rocket and mortar attacks to report on the casualties. It was invariably Vietnamese civilians, not soldiers, who were killed and wounded in these attacks.</p>
<p>In one case, during what one historian called the heaviest rocket attack of the war, I drove a UPI mini-moke into an area on the outskirts of the city and found that many of the civilians there had been wounded. But no ambulance would dare to go into the area.</p>
<p>So I stopped being a reporter and started shuttling the wounded from the shattered area to an ambulance. I think that it may have been one of the better things that I did during the war.</p>
<p>In late May I reported that a mortar attack killed two teenage girls and wounded 24 other civilians near the city’s waterfront. The shell was fired from the other side of the Saigon River, where, despite their setbacks, the Viet Cong were still able to fire rockets and mortar shells into the city in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>One had to wonder what the Communists hoped to accomplish by doing this. South Vietnamese officials speculated that they were trying to show that they were still a force to be reckoned with in the lead-up to peace talks in Paris.</p>
<p><b>One man’s story tells it all</b></p>
<p>Viewing this in retrospect, the rocket attacks that killed mostly unarmed civilians could be seen as a sign of the disarray into which the Communist forces had fallen toward the end of the battle for Saigon.</p>
<p>Also symbolic of this disarray was the plight of a Viet Cong prisoner whom I got to interview in early May, 1968 thanks to the South Vietnamese rangers whose operations I was following.</p>
<p>It was rare for a reporter to get to interview a Viet Cong prisoner.</p>
<p>Le Van Duc, a 26-year-old farm boy from a province south of Saigon had been wounded in the right arm. He told me that was tired. He wanted to go home.</p>
<p>Duc described how he had changed into civilian clothes and walked through Saigon’s back alleys to get out of the ruins of the battle zone and into a street where life was proceeding more or less normally.</p>
<p>He hailed a three-wheel cyclo driven by the leg power of a man wearing short pants and a sun helmet. He told the cyclo driver that he wanted to get to a bus station, where he hoped to find a bus heading south to his native Long An Province.</p>
<p>On the way, Duc passed a North Vietnamese soldier who was also dressed in civilian clothes. He, too, wanted to leave the war. The two shared the cycle. It was first time that either man had been in Saigon and they were a little lost.</p>
<p>Vietnamese rangers stopped the cyclo. They asked the suspicious looking men to produce their identification papers. They had none. The rangers took them away.</p>
<p>In my interview with Duc he said, “We were told our purpose was to liberate Saigon and set up a new government. Our political cadre told us we would succeed.”</p>
<p>“Our job was to attack government installations and police stations in the Fifth Precinct. But government units spotted us and fired on us before we could get to our objectives.”</p>
<p>Why did his company fail to do its job?</p>
<p>“We didn’t have the factor of surprise,” Duc said. “And there was the moonlight. It was difficult to move around in the moonlight.”</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China’s fishing fleet, which reaches as far as Latin America, West Africa, and even Antarctica, is adding to a worldwide strain on fish stocks.</p>
<p>So it’s no surprise that Chinese fishermen have been involved in clashes with foreign fishermen and coast guards at great distances from their homeland.</p>
<p>In perhaps the most dramatic clash, which occurred in March 2016, Argentina’s coast guard sank a Chinese trawler that was fishing within its territorial waters more than 11,000 miles from its home base on the China coast. The trawler had tried to ram the Argentine vessel.</p>
<p>Argentine Navy submarines have been assigned to “chase down illegal fishing vessels in the frigid waters off southern Argentina,” according to a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> report from that country published early this month.</p>
<p>Reuters news agency, meanwhile, reported at the end of August that Ecuador had jailed 20 Chinese fishermen for up to four years for illegally fishing off the Galapagos Islands, where they were caught with some 6,600 sharks.</p>
<p>Their vessel contained some 300 tons of near-extinct or endangered species, including hammerhead sharks.</p>
<p>Incidents have also occurred near South Korea and in disputed areas in the South China Sea, where Chinese Coast Guard ships have clashed with Vietnamese fishermen.</p>
<p>Pressures in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea leading to incidents like this are driving China to fish elsewhere in the world.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Chinese fishermen target West Africa</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></b></p>
<p>In April 2017, <i>The New York Times</i> reported from Senegal that Chinese fishermen were increasingly heading to West Africa.</p>
<p>The fishermen are enabled by corrupt local governments and their weak enforcement of fishing limits.</p>
<p>Citing experts, <i>The Times</i> states that West Africa now provides “the vast majority” of fish caught by China’s distant-water fishing fleet.</p>
<p>Fishing off the coast of Senegal, “most of the Chinese ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as Senegalese boats catch in a year,” <i>The Times</i> report said.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Most of the fish are sent abroad, with some of it ending up as fishmeal fodder for chickens and pigs in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>For Senegalese citizens, many of whom depend on fish as a source of protein, diminishing fish catches mean higher food prices.</p>
<p>In nearby Sierra Leone, meanwhile, a similar scenario is playing out.</p>
<p><i>The Economist </i>Magazine reported on Dec. 7 from Sierra Leone that “nearly half of the population” of 7.4 million people in the small west African nation “does not have enough to eat.”</p>
<p>“But the country’s once plentiful shoals, combined with its weak government, have lured a flotilla of unscrupulous foreign trawlers to its waters.”</p>
<p>Most of the trawlers fly Chinese flags, but dozens also come from South Korea, Italy, Guinea, and Russia.</p>
<p>According to Tabitha Mallory, an expert on these issues, by 2015 more than 160 Chinese fishing enterprises had agreements to operate off the shores of some 40 countries, the high seas, and Antarctica. But other Chinese vessels may be operating in more countries illegally. <b> </b></p>
<p>But in contrast with West Africa, where Chinese fishermen have done great harm to local economies, Antarctica stands out as a new frontier where the fishermen appear to have begun playing by internationally agreed upon rules.</p>
<p>China has joined a commission for the conservation of marine life in Antarctica and has pledged its support for a marine protected area on the cold continent.</p>
<p>However, poor regulation of China’s distant-water fishing (DWF) fleet elsewhere has added to a strain on global fish stocks, according to experts and nongovernmental organizations monitoring the issue.</p>
<p>Greenpeace, a nongovernmental organization which campaigns to change attitudes toward the environment, has found that from 2014-2016, China’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet -- vessels operating outside Chinese territorial waters -- increased by 400 to nearly 2,900.</p>
<p>This followed a similar period of expansion between 2012 and 2014, when the fleet grew by 15 percent each year on average.</p>
<p>By comparison, the United States had just 225 large-size DWF vessels, according to 2015 data.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>China plans to restrict fishing fleet growth</b></p>
<p>The danger posed to fish stocks by China’s growing fleet and the clashes between Chinese fishing boats and foreign fishermen and coast guards, appears to have caused Beijing to start trying to better regulate China’s distant waters fishing fleet -- the largest in the world.</p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Agriculture recently released its 13<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan for distant water fisheries management, restricting the total number of offshore fishing vessels to under 3,000 in 2020 and capping the number of ocean fishing enterprises at 2016 levels.</p>
<p>Writing for the Australia-based <i>Policy Forum</i>, Tabitha Mallory says that the recent policy moves by the Chinese government “encouragingly point to a new focus on the long-term sustainability of global fish stocks.”</p>
<p>Fisheries experts, Mallory says, don’t agree on the extent to which global fish stocks are depleted. But they do agree that most stocks are in decline.</p>
<p>Fish stocks in Africa and Southeast Asia are “under-assessed” and “under-regulated,” says Mallory.</p>
<p>But these are “precisely the regions where the China’s distant-water fishing fleet is highly active,” says Mallory, who is an affiliate professor at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Mallory is also a consultant at the China Ocean Institute.</p>
<p>“The good news is that the Chinese government has recently acknowledged that there’s a problem,” she says.</p>
<p>But Mallory says that this should not be overstated.</p>
<p>“We’re not out of the woods,” she says, adding that a number of Chinese fishing vessels are still fishing illegally and unsustainably.</p>
<p>China’s fishing fleet expansion has been fueled by preferential policies, including tax breaks on imports of fishing equipment purchased abroad and subsidies for fuel and vessel building.</p>
<p>But for the first time, the Chinese government is currently no longer calling for an expansion of the fleet.</p>
<p>“These policy shifts …indicate that China values its reputation abroad and that it pays attention to the reactions to its behavior from the international community,” Mallory says.</p>
<p>Another positive sign is that China has been shifting much of its fish production to aquaculture. Prof. Mallory describes this as “a boom.”</p>
<p>But also worth watching in the future are Chinese provinces and companies which would still like to expand their fishing catch rather than curb it.</p>
<p>Greenpeace says that a decision to delegate the management of China’s vessel monitoring system (VMS) to the China Distant Water Fisheries Association, a private organization representing fishing boat operators, constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Then there is the murky issue of fuel subsidies for fishing-boat operators, which are often provided by provincial authorities.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, the World Trade Organization has been calling for a more disciplined policy regarding fishing-boat subsidies.</p>
<p>Dr. Mallory predicts that more mergers and acquisitions will occur in the Chinese fishing industry. “Transparency in these deals is essential but often lacking,” she says.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>Cambodia’s Tonle Sap, a lake known as the country’s “beating heart,” faces a more rapid decline than previously estimated, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Experts say that urgent countermeasures are needed to save Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake, which has served Cambodia for millennia.</p>
<p>Millions of Cambodians depend on the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap for fish catches that provide them with their main source of protein.</p>
<p>Cambodian fishermen pull more than 400,000 tons of fish out of the Tonle Sap each year, making the lake the world’s largest and most productive inland fishery.</p>
<p>The new study focusing on the sediment flow in Southeast Asia’s longest river was produced by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), an independent nonprofit research organization.</p>
<p>The damage done to fish migration to and from the Tonle Sap by upstream dams in China and Laos has already been widely reported.</p>
<p>The dams and their reservoirs block adult fish trying to migrate upstream and  larvae and juveniles trying to migrate downstream.</p>
<p>But the damage to the Tonle Sap caused by a decline in sediment flows which have been disrupted by the dams has been less well studied.</p>
<p>Robust sediment flows to the Tonle Sap lakebed help to nourish the plants and smaller organisms on which the fish feed. Without this sediment, the lake’s food chain is likely to collapse.</p>
<p>According the SEI report, factors leading to “a drastic reduction in sediment loads” in the Mekong include hydroelectric dams, riverbed mining for sand, land-use changes, and climate change.</p>
<p>Among these factors, the report says, the most important are the dams’ reservoirs and riverbed mining.</p>
<p>Climate change, which has brought extreme weather changes, including increasingly intense floods and drought, exacerbates the situation, it says.</p>
<p>The sand dredged from the Mekong riverbed goes mostly into concrete. The concrete has been used in the dams and in other Chinese projects being built along the riverbanks and for the Chinese-backed construction of a China-Laos railroad and its tunnels.</p>
<p><b>The Stakes </b></p>
<p>The stakes are huge. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Mekong counts for up to 25 percent of the global freshwater catch and provides livelihoods for at least 60 million people.</p>
<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) says that the Mekong is the second most biodiverse river in the world after the Amazon.</p>
<p>The river supports the largest inland fishery in the world. But dams have been disrupting the migration of more than 100 species of fish.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, researchers have warned in recent years that a loss of fish resources caused by dam building could devastate the health of rural children.</p>
<p>And experts have documented signs of chronic malnutrition in a number of villages.</p>
<p>In 2010, The Mekong River Commission (MRC) recommended that all damming be postponed through 2020.</p>
<p>The MRC was formed in 1995 through an agreement among the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam to ensure the “reasonable and equitable use” of the Mekong River system.</p>
<p>But the commission’s findings are nonbinding, and China is not a member of the MRC.</p>
<p><b>The importance of sediment</b></p>
<p>Sediment might sound like an arcane subject studied by no one but agricultural experts. But for farmers and fishermen living downstream from China, it can mean life or death.</p>
<p>According to Thanapon Piman, a researcher for the SEI and lead author of its report, sediment is “critical for the formation and stabilization of deltas and the ecosystems they support.”</p>
<p>Sediment, or silt, enrichs the entire Lower Mekong Basin and supports farms, irrigation, fisheries, water quality, and water-based plants.</p>
<p>Dr. Thanaphon says that if all of the dams proposed for the Lower Mekong Basin are developed, including dams that are planned or ongoing, this could prevent more than 90 percent of Mekong’s sediment load from being transported downstream.</p>
<p>The SEI report isn’t the first of its kind to warn of looming, mostly man-made disasters on the Mekong.</p>
<p>A 2012 study by the Washington, D.C.-based National Academy of Sciences identified Cambodia’s Lower Sesan 2 tributary dam as the most destructive to fish biodiversity of the country’s dams.</p>
<p>The dam was expected to endanger 56 fish species. That impact will be felt across Cambodia as well as in the neighboring countries of Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In June 2014, <i>The New York Times </i>reported that a growing population of fishermen at the Tonle Sap were engaging in overfishing. The cutting of mangrove swamps that shelter fish added to the damage.</p>
<p>During the dry season, the Tonle Sap feeds the Mekong River, releasing water that irrigates and nourishes crops to the southeast</p>
<p>But during the rainy season, the Mekong backs up into the Tonle Sap.</p>
<p>In brief, the waters of the Tonle Sap ebb and flow with the annual cycle of the river that feeds it. The Tonle Sap River connects the lake to the Mekong.</p>
<p>The ebb and flow of its waters gives Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake the nickname “Cambodia’s beating heart.”</p>
<p>The good news is that many internationally recognized scientists have been monitoring and reporting on the Mekong and Tonle Sap.</p>
<p>A team involving some of these scientists has been studying the impact of upstream dams in China and Laos on the Tonle Sap since 2012 and has built a computer model to track developments there.</p>
<p>International organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union have been supporting studies on environmental flows and food security in the region.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department runs a Lower Mekong Initiative in support of such activities.</p>
<p>The SEI report was published with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>
<p>Last year, Radio Free Asia sent a cameraman to document changes occurring along the Mekong. When he visited the Tonle Sap a representative for five communes depending on the lake spoke of its importance to Cambodia.</p>
<p>“If the Tonle Sap is alive,” he said, “then the Mekong is alive.”</p>
<p>But over the past five to six years, the water flow has been unpredictable and the fish catch declining.</p>
<p>As RFA’s cameraman reported in a series of blogs titled “A River in Peril,” fishermen working on the Tonle Sap on a daily basis report that they sometimes find no fish at all.</p>
<p>Some fishermen have given up. Young men are leaving to find work elsewhere. Some head to neighboring Thailand or even as far away as South Korea.</p>
<p>Writing for <i>The Phnom Penh Post </i>on Aug. 1 of this year, Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon summed up the view of many experts that “Cambodia’s most important ecosystem is in crisis.”</p>
<p>‘The ecosystem of the gigantic lake is set to spectacularly collapse,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“At least…,” he says, “if drastic measures aren’t taken—and soon.”</p>
<p>“Such was the prevailing sentiment” he says, at an International Symposium on “Flood Pulse Ecosystems” held in Siem Reap, Cambodia, where researchers convened in late July this year.</p>
<p>Sassoon said that the tone at the conference “alternated between frustrated and funereal.”</p>
<p><b>What can be done?</b></p>
<p>Any solution to saving the Tonle Sap and other fishing grounds in or near the Mekong River would have to begin with a curb on dam building, much of it carried out by Chinese state-owned companies.</p>
<p>In all, more than 15 countries’ companies are engaged in dam-building.</p>
<p>In China, six dams have been completed with 13 more under construction or planned.</p>
<p>Laos has plans for 140 dams with roughly 30 percent of them completed. Most of them are dams located on tributaries.</p>
<p>According to Brian Eyler,  an expert on the issues, tributary dams can disrupt “environmental flows,”  such as fish migration and sediment distribution, just as seriously as mainstream dams do.</p>
<p>Eyler directs the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan research center based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Two mainstream dams in Laos, which are still under construction, have designs intended to mitigate damage to fish built into them, such as fish ladders.</p>
<p>Laos’s Xayaburi dam has extensive fish modifications, including a fish elevator never tried before and accommodations for fish passage in the navigation lock system, Eyler says.</p>
<p>Xayaburi also has installed expensive sediment flushing gates.</p>
<p>The Don Sahong dam uses a modification of natural passages in channels adjacent of the dam site to permit fish passage. The developer deepened and widened these passages to permit fish passage in the dry season.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen, Eyler says, whether these innovations will produce predicted results.</p>
<p>“The simple truth is that we still don’t know enough about the dams’ impacts on fish migration to determine before and after impacts of these two projects,” says Eyler.</p>
<p>According to Eyler, this is why The Mekong River Commission recommended in 2010 that all damming on the Mekong mainstream be postponed through 2020 until more data is collected.</p>
<p>“These dams use untested fish-mitigation technology, so even modeling results from the developer should be questioned and scrutinized,” says Eyler.</p>
<p>Cambodia itself has plans for 60 dams, with about 10 percent of them completed. But only one of the completed dams, the much-criticized Sesan 2 dam, is located in the Mekong Basin and relatively near the Tonle Sap.</p>
<p>At a workshop held in Ho Chi Minh City on Nov. 30, experts argued that a growing awareness of the inefficiencies and high costs of hydropower should induce Laos and other countries to take another look at renewable energy.</p>
<p>Eyler, who chaired the workshop, has long argued that the current hydropower system in Laos favors the needs of investors, which are short-term and driven by the bottom line.</p>
<p>In Eyler’s view, the energy infrastructure in Laos, while designed to make Laos “the battery of Southeast Asia,” is “highly inefficient.”</p>
<p>Nikky Nkiruka Avila from the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley, said that hydropower dams are becoming more costly.</p>
<p>She advocated the increased use of other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar powered energy, noting that the prices for the equipment needed for these sources have plummeted.</p>
<p>Laos and Cambodia offer ideal conditions for solar and wind power generation.</p>
<p>These renewable energy sources could potentially substitute for dams now in the planning stage. If built, those dams could become the most disruptive for environmental flows yet.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China’s growing presence in Antarctica is causing alarm among some experts in Australia, which has big stakes in the resource-rich continent.</p>
<p>A recent report from the nonpartisan Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) alleges that China has been conducting secret military activities in Antarctica and may be making a grab for land there.</p>
<p>The report’s author, Anne-Marie Brady, a highly regarded political science professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, says that China’s aims may be at odds with Australia’s strategic interests.</p>
<p>China, she says, “has conducted undeclared military activities in Antarctica, is building a case for a territorial claim, and is engaging in military exploration there.”</p>
<p>Antarctica isn’t a country. It’s governed through an international treaty which was signed in 1959 by 12 countries whose scientists were working there at the time.</p>
<p>China is a relative newcomer to Antarctica.  It joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983.</p>
<p>According to the ASPI report, China is rapidly expanding its presence in a triangle-shaped area in the Australian Antarctic Territory. Chinese officials have stated in documents Beijing’s right to make a territorial claim.</p>
<p>Antarctica, roughly the size of the U.S. and Mexico combined, is a mostly uninhabited, ice-covered land mass.</p>
<p>Australia claims 42 per cent of the polar continent, the largest claim by far of any of the nations with a presence there.</p>
<p><b>United States research program</b></p>
<p>The United States’ claim is smaller, but <i>New York Times</i> reporters who visited Antarctica in the summer of 2017 reported that the U.S.-run McMurdo station on the edge of the continent “has long been the most ambitious Antarctic research program run by any nation.”</p>
<p>On the negative side, the National Science Foundation, which runs U.S. research programs in Antarctica, has decided that aging, inefficient buildings at the McMurdo research station must be replaced.</p>
<p>The cost of replacing those buildings would almost certainly come to hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the<i> New York Times</i> correspondents in a report published by <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> on July 17.</p>
<p>They add, however, that “in an era when the Trump administration is seeking to slash federal spending, the fate of Antarctic research is an open question.”</p>
<p>A more immediate issue, they say, is whether the U.S. Congress will allocate money for ice-breaking ships that would ensure that American bases in Antarctica can be resupplied every year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China is now replacing Russia as the United States’ main competitor in Antarctica.</p>
<p>China has four research bases, with a fifth planned. According to <i>The</i> <i>Times</i>’ report, the U.S. has three bases and multiple field camps, with an overall program still far larger than China’s.</p>
<p>The McMurdo base, originally built by the U.S. Navy in 1957 during the early stages of the Cold War, houses more than 1,200 residents, the largest community in all of Antarctica.</p>
<p><b>China’s goals</b></p>
<p>China hasn’t publicly explained its goals in great detail to foreigners, but Brady says that her Chinese contacts and Chinese-language research show that Beijing is looking for resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons, and fish.</p>
<p>Other goals include the promotion of tourism, the opening of new transportation routes, securing sources of water, and “bioprospecting.”</p>
<p>All of this fits into China’s strategic goal of achieving great-power status, according to Brady.</p>
<p>As she explains it, China also views access to both Antarctica and the Arctic as essential for the rollout of the country’s BeiDou satellite navigation system, China’s space science program, and accurate weather forecasting in China.</p>
<p>Concerns about China’s satellite navigation system go back to at least October 2013, when an ASPI report warned about the possible militarization of Antarctic bases on a continent often called “a land of peace and science.”</p>
<p>In 2014 Norwegian writer Brad Wormdal, the author of <i>Satellite War</i>, told Fairfax Media that China wanted to use the BeiDou navigation system to create a capability to guide missiles. A BeiDou base in Antarctica, he said, would make the system “more reliable and precise.”</p>
<p>The BeiDou navigation system is based on “dual use technology.” This means that it can be used both for scientific research and for the guidance of offensive missiles.</p>
<p><b>China’s military involvement</b></p>
<p>In a new book titled <i>China as a Polar Great Power</i>, Brady says that as far back as five years ago, in 2012, Chinese officials told her that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would increasingly participate in China’s Antarctic expeditions.</p>
<p>The Chinese officials cited the precedent set by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, all of which use their armed forces and contractors in Antarctica to help staff research stations and provide transportation and cargo handling.</p>
<p>China’s decision to deploy its military, Brady says, would be legitimate if China were to publicly state that it is involving its military in Antarctic affairs.</p>
<p>But she adds that “other than in its first expedition, China has neglected to notify other Antarctic Treaty states of the PLA’s ongoing involvement in Antarctic logistics and strategic science.”</p>
<p>“Increasing the level of involvement of the Chinese military in the Antarctic program will greatly enhance China’s operating capability and enable PLA personnel to gain experience in operating in polar conditions,” says Brady.</p>
<p>Brady says that Australia has underfunded its programs in Antarctica while over the past decade China, as a result of budget increases, has become a major investor,  going from being “a minor player” in  the polar region to becoming  a “major actor.”</p>
<p>ASPI’s 2013 report said that Australia’s budget for Antarctic operations has faced crippling restrictions, with the overall budget for 2013-14 facing an eight percent cut from the previous year’s budget.</p>
<p><b>A word about Antarctica</b></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in contrast with the Arctic region, Antarctica is one of the coldest regions on earth.</p>
<p>The BBC has called it “the driest, coldest, windiest place in the world.”</p>
<p>But the French National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, or CNRS) explains that Antarctica “turns out to be the best location for scientists…”</p>
<p>According to CNRS, this includes cosmologists, geophysicists, space mission coordinators, and even psychologists pursuing research in their fields.</p>
<p>And for astronomers, CNRS says that Antarctica is the world’s best earth-based observatory.</p>
<p>According to the website World Data, Antarctica has the cleanest air with minimal background radiation.  Cloud cover only rarely hides the stars.</p>
<p>Research stations are spread across the continent, with a total of 70 permanent research stations representing 30 countries.</p>
<p><b>China’s propaganda at home and abroad</b></p>
<p>In her book, Brady says that the Chinese government “spares no effort to hide its designs on Antarctic mineral resources from possible foreign criticism to the extent of even deliberately mistranslating a speech” by China’s President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>One of the tasks assigned to China’s state media, which includes among others China Radio International and CCTV International, now known as China Global News (CGN),  is to respond, usually indirectly, to international controversies about China.</p>
<p>Brady says that in November 2014, when President Xi visited Australia, the Australian media were speculating over the implications of China’s expansion of its BeiDou satellite navigation system to Antarctica.</p>
<p>The <i>China Daily</i>, China’s official English-language newspaper, avoided commenting on the controversy directly. It instead translated a quote from Xi’s speech given while he was visiting a Chinese icebreaker in port at Hobart, Australia.</p>
<p>Xi was quoted by <i>China Daily</i> on Nov. 19, 2014 as saying that “scientific work in Antarctica is important work that will benefit humankind, and China has contributed to peaceful use of the continent.”</p>
<p>According to Brady, the official Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website carried a more complete version of the speech, in English, that “might have aroused greater misgivings if any of the journalists following the story had looked at it.”</p>
<p>As Brady notes in her book, China’s expanding polar presence is consistently explained to the Chinese public, through Chinese-language sources, as “being part of China’s efforts to secure a share of polar resources.”</p>
<p>In the more complete version of Xi Jinping’s speech, he was reported to have said, “The Chinese side stands ready to continuously work with Australia and the international community to better understand, protect, and <i>exploit</i> the Antarctic.”</p>
<p>The <i>China Daily</i> version, however, used the word “explore” instead of the word “exploit.”</p>
<p>Brady says that China is assuming that foreigners won’t know what their leader is saying in the original Chinese and therefore not be aware that China’s goal is to exploit the continent’s resources.</p>
<p>China’s expanding polar presence is explained to the Chinese public in Chinese as “being part of China’s efforts to secure a share of polar resources,” Brady says.</p>
<p>This will in turn, she says, “underwrite China’s continued economic growth” and serve as an indicator of China’s “improved comprehensive national strength.”</p>
<p>In other words, the Chinese people, and not the just the scientists, will see a payoff from China’s presence in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, environmental experts are focusing on what could go wrong with China’s many activities in Antarctica—regardless of whether they involve either exploration or exploitation.</p>
<p>They’re particularly concerned with the potential impact of any mining or fishing on Antarctica’s marine life.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>China recently launched Asia’s biggest dredging ship, raising fears in Southeast Asia that Beijing will use it to further its claims over disputed territory in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The Tiankun, dubbed by designers as “the magical island maker,” won’t enter service until June of next year, according to China’s official Xinhua news service.</p>
<p>The 140-meter-long vessel is currently being tested in waters off China’s Jiangsu Province, which is located in the eastern part of China and far from the South China Sea. Its ultimate destination was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Experts are puzzling over what signals Beijing might be sending by announcing the vessel’s launch shortly before an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting was set to begin in Vietnam.</p>
<p>According to Murray Hiebert, senior associate in the Southeast Asia Program at the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Beijing may be showing off its new dredger as a signal to President Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p>The aim would be “to show that China has global interests, including in the Asia-Pacific,” says Hiebert.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the “magical” dredger by Xinhua on Nov. 3, says Hiebert, “can also be seen as a signal to Southeast Asia claimants in the South China Sea, particularly Vietnam.”</p>
<p>Putting it another way, China seems to be telling rival claimants that China is in the South China Sea to stay and may build more artificial islands with military installations on them to protect its claims.</p>
<p>Vietnam has stood out—at least until recently—as the most vocal among Southeast Asian nations resisting China’s moves to dominate the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The regional sea carries one third of the world’s maritime trade. It’s also said to harbor rich deposits of oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>The importance of the oil reserves was dramatized during an incident involving China and Vietnam which occurred in early August of this year.</p>
<p>A Spanish company contracted by Hanoi said that it had suspended oil drilling in a block off Vietnam, “where prospecting in South China Sea waters claimed by China infuriated Beijing and brought Chinese pressure on Vietnam to stop,” according to a Reuters news agency report.</p>
<p>Western scientists say that the vast waterway’s diverse marine environment also adds to the sea’s importance.</p>
<p>Millions of people depend on fish from the South China Sea as their main source of protein. But the sea has been overfished by China’s fishing fleet, leaving some fish species in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>As the demand for fish grows among China’s middle class, overfishing has threatened the survival of some fish species, and fish stocks have declined, as they have in many other parts of the world</p>
<p>Some forms of dredging have also destroyed coral reefs, which protect and support certain species of fish.</p>
<p>Dredgers stir up plumes of sand and silt that damage coral tissue and block sunlight from organisms such as reef-building corals which cannot survive without it, according to reports published in scientific journals.</p>
<p>Since 2013 China has been dredging sand, gravel, and silt in the South China Sea and depositing it onto rocks, reefs, and sandbars to create artificial islands.</p>
<p>Chinese military and construction teams have followed up by building airstrips that can accommodate fighter planes and placing hangers, radar, and anti-aircraft guns on the islands.</p>
<p>The newly unveiled dredger will be more powerful than any used previously.</p>
<p>According to Xinhua, the Tiankun, designed by the Tianjin Dredging Co., can dredge 6,000 cubic meters per hour, dig as deep as 35 meters under the sea floor, and pump sand and silt into the vessel. It can then blow the sand and silt out as far as 15, 000 meters away.</p>
<p><b>Territorial disputes </b></p>
<p>China claims most of the South China Sea as its territorial waters, based on what it describes as history going back for centuries.</p>
<p>But six governments have overlapping claims with China in the vast waterway, including those of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Taiwan’s claims are almost identical to those of China.</p>
<p>China says that the much-disputed Paracel and Spratly Islands were once under the control of imperial China.</p>
<p>Vietnam disputes China’s historical account, saying that China never claimed sovereignty over these islands until the 1940s.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the islands’ claimants are gathering in Vietnam this weekend for an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit.</p>
<p>Speaking on Friday in Da Nang, Vietnam, U.S. President Donald Trump delivered an “America First” speech focused on what he described as unfair trade practices.</p>
<p>When it came to what Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations consider to be China’s growing dominance in the South China Sea, Trump made a clear reference to the South China Sea, mentioning a need for “freedom of navigation and overflight, including open shipping lanes.”</p>
<p>The United States takes no position on various sovereignty claims in the region.</p>
<p>But the U.S. does conduct “freedom-of-navigation” operations in which it challenges Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea by sailing through international waters.</p>
<p>The latest of these occurred a month ago, on Oct. 10, when the missile destroyer USS Chafee entered waters near the Paracel Islands.</p>
<p>This triggered a public complaint from a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.</p>
<p>Trump’s Da Nang speech on Friday also spoke of creating a free and open “Indo-Pacific region” through a grouping of four democracies-- U.S., Japan, Australia, and India.</p>
<p>According to <i>The Wall Street Journal’s</i> veteran columnist Andrew Browne, such a grouping would look to China “like a strategy to contain its advance.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beijing is not halting that advance.</p>
<p>As Browne puts it, China’s President Xi Jinping “is likely to calculate that time is on his side”</p>
<p>China’s new super-dredger “embodies Beijing’s strategy of pushing Chinese interests by any means short of war,” says Browne.</p>

		    <![CDATA[
            <p>As Vietnam prepares to host a major international meeting starting a week from now, the country’s leaders appear to be running scared.</p>
<p>Since early last year Vietnam has been cracking down on citizens who advocate democratic reforms.</p>
<p>A record number of dissidents and bloggers have been jailed. Many have been harassed and beaten not only by the regular police but also by unidentified thugs working on the Party’s behalf.</p>
<p>All of this has been happening as Vietnam prepares for the 2017 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings to be held in Da Nang Nov. 6-11. Leaders from 21 member countries are expected to attend.</p>
<p>One cause of official nervousness in Hanoi could be what happened when Vietnam hosted the annual APEC meetings 11 years ago, in 2006.</p>
<p>On the eve of the 2006 APEC Summit, a coalition of Vietnamese dissidents issued a manifesto advocating democratic reforms. The group called itself Bloc 8406, based on the date when it issued the manifesto—April 8, 2006.</p>
<p>Following that summit, the Vietnamese authorities arrested, tried, and imprisoned leaders of the group.</p>
<p>On Aug. 1 this year, Carlyle A. Thayer, a leading Australian expert on Vietnam, published a background brief for his consultancy on the more recent increase in arrests of activists, bloggers and citizen journalists.</p>
<p>Thayer said that the timing of their arrests and trials indicates that Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security has been “taking preemptive action far in advance of the APEC Summit…”</p>
<p>Vietnam doesn’t want a repeat of 2006, said Thayer.</p>
<p>The aim this time, he said, is “to break up networks of troublemakers and to intimidate other would-be activists from making public protests on the internet or in street demonstrations.”</p>
<p>Thayer lists several other factors that would explain the increase in arrests of activists and bloggers. They include a likely assessment by Vietnamese security officials that the Trump administration will make “only routine protests” about the arrest of activists and bloggers.</p>
<p>David Brown, a former U.S. diplomat who closely follows Vietnamese developments, takes a different view.</p>
<p>“The crackdown on dissident activists has nothing much to do with Donald Trump or with APEC,” says Brown. “It’s an attempt by Party ideologues … to return Vietnam to those halcyon pre-internet days when the dissident community numbered at most a thousand people who hung out in certain Hanoi and  Saigon coffee shops.”</p>
<p>During a Communist Party Congress last year, the Party’s General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and his allies imposed a hard line that diminished the influence of Party reformers.</p>
<p><b>Anti-Chinese Feelings</b></p>
<p>Another factor involved in the preemptive arrests of dissidents relates to Vietnam’s relations with China, according to Thayer.</p>
<p>In May 2014 a series of anti-China protests erupted in Vietnam in response to China’s deployment of an oil drilling rig to a disputed region of the South China Sea not far from the coast of Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government at first permitted some of the protests to go ahead in order to show its displeasure with China’s move. But when the protests erupted into violence, some of it against Chinese-owned factories, the government began cracking down. At least four Chinese citizens were killed in the rioting.</p>
<p>China removed the oil rig, and Vietnam and China began gradually repairing badly strained relations.</p>
<p>Thayer notes that many of the recent arrests have included bloggers who have been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. Those actions have included Chinese Coast Guard and maritime militia attacks on Vietnamese fishing boats in disputed waters claimed by both China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Visitors to Vietnam sometimes detect strong anti-Chinese feelings based on much more than the oil-rig incident. A history of battles between Vietnamese and Chinese that went on for centuries has not been forgotten by many Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And a brief war in 1979, during which China invaded the northern region of Vietnam and was repulsed, also left bad feelings, partly because of the Chinese army’s destruction of towns, villages, schools, hospitals, and a railroad line during the Chinese retreat from Vietnam.</p>
<p>At the same time, pro-American feelings have been on the rise for some time.</p>
<p>Thousands of young Vietnamese are now studying in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Human rights issues</b></p>
<p>On Oct. 26 during a visit to Hanoi, Michael Mazza of the conservative Washington D.C.-based American Enterprise Institute described the state of U.S.-Vietnam relations as he sees it.</p>
<p>Mazza notes the increase in U.S. trade with Vietnam and how the two countries have “begun to pursue a relationship that, over time, “may become one with real strategic heft.”</p>
<p>But he also mentions impediments to a deeper relationship, the greatest of which is Vietnam’s approach to human rights.</p>
<p>“There has been modest if uneven progress when it comes to religious freedom and the rule of law,” he says.</p>
<p>But democracy is not on the horizon and, though the number of prisoners of conscience had been slowly declining through 2015, “there has been a crackdown on political dissent since the beginning of last year.”</p>
<p>“Vietnamese people enjoy neither freedom of speech nor freedom of assembly,” stressed Mazza.</p>
<p>Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranks Vietnam this year close to the bottom of its World Press Freedom Index--175<sup>th</sup> out of 180 countries.</p>
